            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Right Reverend Father in God, HENRY, Lord Bishop of <hi>LONDON,</hi> ONE OF THE Lords of His MAJESTIES Most Honourable Privy Council.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough the Sacred Maintenance of Tithes be not so necessary to the Being of a Church, as a true Faith and a right Way of Worship, yet it is so requisite to the Well-being thereof, that after my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb facs="tcp:95318:3"/> to vindicate our excellent Forms of Worship, I hope it is not improper for me to undertake the defence of that Holy Revenue which supports them. For since our Lord chooses Men for his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and doth not feed, cloath, or teach them by Miracle now, these Divine Offices will be but meanly performed, unless such Provisions be made for those that do Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister them, as may keep them from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, ignorance, and contempt. And the miserable condition of those Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es which have been unhappily or wickedly stript of that Inheritance, which God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the honour and defence of Christianity, may teach us both to be thankful for the Prudence and Piety of for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer Ages in endowing this Church, and to beware of there designs in this Age, who out of Envy or Covetousness would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish or destroy these just and useful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments. It is very sad to consider, that even of Gods ancient Patrimony, <hi>Tithes,</hi> so much was first alienated by the Pope, and is still detained by such as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to hate all Popish Practices and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb facs="tcp:95318:3"/> (but what tends to their profit) that many Churches cannot afford their poor Incumbents food and rayment; yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of restoring, at least a Competency, which the very Law of Nature requires, too many do endeavour by all kind of Artifices to lessen those Dues that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, and are so far from imitating the Charity of former Times in giving any thing to God out of their own, that they will not be so just as to let us quietly enjoy what others have freely given us. Which bold and manifest Sacriledge<note n="(a)" place="margin">Si vero is qui pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pria vota non reddit infidelis esse convincitur, quanto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joris impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis reus est, qui ea quae alii vove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt &amp; red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diderunt u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpat. <hi>Agobard. de disp. rei Eccles. cap. 11.</hi>
               </note>, I have reason to believe many have been encouraged to commit by that currant and commonly received Error, <hi>That Tithes are not due by Divine right, but only by humane positive Constitutions.</hi> For in the days of our Fathers, while the Divine right was generally maintained and believed, it was thought a matter of Conscience to pay Tithes justly. But now they that are either so cunning to avoid discovery, or so great to despise the punishments of the Law, do without scruple in part, or in whole, substract or detain their Tithes,
<pb facs="tcp:95318:4"/> and by this false Principle are perswaded it is no Sin that they need to repent of, so that the same Error that encourages them to do this great injury to the Church, causeth them to do a greater to their own Souls. And since this Opinion is as false as it is mischeivous, being a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern invention, which contradicts Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and Reason, and the Judgment and Practice of the best Men in all times and places (all which declare for the Divine right of Tithes) I esteemed my self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, as well in duty to the Church as in Charity to the Souls of such as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, to confute that pernicious Error, that <hi>Tithes are only due by Humane right;</hi> a Principle too unwarily received by some that are no Enemies to the Church, who do not consider that this was the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all those Petitions made to the late usurping Power for taking away Tithes, <hi>viz.</hi> That the same Authority which gave them beginning might alter or abolish them when they pleased; which Petitions, if Providence had not prevented their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, had ended in the utter ruine of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb facs="tcp:95318:4"/> it self. I am sure the Divine Right of Tithes hath been the Opinion of the best and most learned Men in all Ages, and I see no reason why we should desert so ancient, so universal, so useful, and so well attested a Truth in this Age, when so many are rather desirous than able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it. As for the Libels of the wilder Sects, there is so much noise and so little sense in their railing rather than reasoning against Tithes, that they are not worth confuting: For all that they or any others say against the Divine Right, which looks like Argument, is borrowed from the Learned Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> (whose industry and parts I must own with respect, while I censure his partiality, and discover his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes) His more learned than faithful History of Tithes, hath been, if not the Parent, yet the Nurse of this common and mischievous Error: wherefore I have very strictly examined it, and by filling up the Omissions, removing the Objections, and modestly observing the Mistakes thereof, I have not only vindicated the Opinion of the Divine right of Tithes, but shewed the
<pb facs="tcp:95318:5"/> Practice of all Ages and Nations hath been agreeable thereunto, and this with so much brevity, that if my Reader do not compare Mr. <hi>Seldens</hi> History with this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, he may sometimes complain of some obscurity in the style; but I hope he will find no designed faults in the Matter, which affords a methodical and compleat History of Opinion and Fact in the Case of Tithes, from the beginning of the World unto the Times of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with many useful accounts of the Original of Parishes, Patronages, Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Exemptions, Appropriations, and Infeodations, all which rightly explained serve to clear our Opinion concerning the constant belief of the Divine Original of Tithes.</p>
            <p>I know in such an Age as this, I must expect the censures and displeasure of all such who have upon trust admired my great and eminent Adversary, and also of all whose secular interest engages them to disgust this undoubted Truth: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have presumed to flie to Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Patronage and Protection, with great
<pb facs="tcp:95318:5"/> assurance of Your exemplary Zeal in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting, and Your generous Courage in defending all Pious designs that tend to the honour of Religion, and to the safety of the Church; and if your Lordship will please to accept, and own all that is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable in these Pages, I shall esteem my self sufficiently armed against all assaults, by the honesty of my Intentions, the equity of my Cause, and by the Honour of being accounted,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE great Fame of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s Learning hath given such reputation to all his Works, and among the rest to this <hi>History of Tithes,</hi> that many who never examined the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars receive it all for infallible Truth: but <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> hath taught me to prefer no Man before the Truth<note n="(a)" place="margin">Justin. <hi>Martyr. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 47.</note>; and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> himself saith, <hi>He doth not wish his Book should gain any strength of Truth from his Name alone</hi>
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">Preface, pag. <hi>11.</hi>
               </note>, yea he bids every one <hi>try it with the most censorious Examination</hi>
               <note n="(c)" place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>22.</hi>
               </note>, adding —<hi>&amp; si tibi vera videtur, Dede ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, aut si falsa est accingere contra.</hi> Invited by which Admonition, I have diligently examined this History, yet without any censoriousness, and with all due respect to the Authors Learning: and (notwithstanding all his Protestations in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of his Preface) I find very many mistaken and false Quotations, with divers forced and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious Interpretations of such places as are truly cited, as also innumerable Omissions of things ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry material, which seem to be left out by design, because Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his vast reading, makes it very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely he should not meet with obvious things in
<pb facs="tcp:95318:7"/> common Authors. And since my only aim is, to rectifie the Errors and supply the defects of this History, I hope this Great mans Friends will not be offended, while he himself saith, <hi>If I through ignorance have omitted any thing in the History or Review, which deserved place in either of them, whoever shall admonish me of it, shall have a most willing acknowledgment of his Learning and Courtesie</hi>
               <note n="(d)" place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>12.</hi>
               </note>. I know it is commonly thought the Clergy are no Friends to this <hi>History of Tithes;</hi> but there is no reason they should dislike it, if his performances had suited that protestation which he makes here, <hi>That it was not written to prove, Tithes are not due by the Law of God, or that the Laity may detain them, or still enjoy Appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—nor was it written at all against the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Clergy—nor is any end in it to teach any Innovation, by an imperfect pattern had from the musty Relicks of former times</hi>
               <note n="(e)" place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>1,</hi> &amp; <hi>2.</hi>
               </note>. But he that reads the Book it self will find, that (forgetting these fair professions) he conceals some of the best Proofs for Tithes, rejects others, and questions all that seem to establish the Divine right or Ʋniversal practice of Tithes, greedily searching after, and plausibly setting off all that appears to make against it. Yet I am confident, divers have stretched some passages of this Book further than ever Mr. S. intended, and have drawn Conclusions from it, which he (if yet alive) would blush to see; for since the beginning of our late Sacrilegious Civil War this History hath been the Armory, to which all Sectaries and Covetors of the Church Revenues have resorted, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
<pb facs="tcp:95318:7"/> and Arguments against this Sacred Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Clergy: so that it is not only for the good of the Church, but for the vindication of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Memory, to prevent those who would make an evil use of this Book, the ill consequence whereof, when Mr. <hi>S.</hi> himself foresaw (almost as soon as it was printed) He did repent of writing it; and <hi>Jan. 28, 1618,</hi> appearing at <hi>Lambeth</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>George</hi> Bishop of <hi>Canterbury, Lancelot</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Rochester,</hi> and three Knights, Doctors of Civil Law, sitting judicially, He made this submission under his own Hand: <hi>My good Lords, I most humbly acknowledge my Error which I have committed in publishing the</hi> History of Tithes, <hi>and especially in that I have at all by shewing any interpretation of Holy Scripture, by medling with Councils, Fathers, or Canons, or by what else soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver occurs in it, offered any occasion of Argument against any right of maintenance</hi> Jure Divino, <hi>of the Ministers of the Gospel; beseeching Your Lordships to receive this humble and ingenuous Acknowledgment, together with the unfeigned Protestation of my Grief, for that through it I have so incurred both His Majesties and Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships displeasure, conceived against me in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Church of</hi> England. This was then taken for a Retractation, and though the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness of the late Times emboldned Men of less knowledge to urge this Book as Authentic in all its conclusions; yet the Learned Author himself did not (that I know of) print any Vindication of it, though it was writ against by divers considerable
<pb facs="tcp:95318:8"/> Men in his own life time, which is (to me) a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing proof, That he was conscious of many great Mistakes in it. And if any can hardly believe so Learned a Man should commit so many Errors, they do not consider that he was not much above Thirty years of Age when he writ this, and being a Man of business was forced to take many of his numberless Quotations upon trust from others, and particularly from Sir <hi>Rob. Cotton,</hi> as he partly confesses in the Epistle.

<pb facs="tcp:95318:8"/> by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> himself, and very often by the Famous Dr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> Dr. <hi>Teldesly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nettle,</hi> and some others who formerly answered this <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Tithes,</hi> but their Books are now so very scarce, and all of them so large, that few have opportunity to get them, or leisure to read them: wherefore I judge it will be a very useful under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to examine and collect all their Remarks upon this History, and (omitting whatever was less weighty or petinent) to put into a clear method their closest Instances and Arguments, adding all along variety of my own Observations for a full discovery of the Truth in this point of <hi>Tithes,</hi> so that whatever is material either for it or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, may be seen at one view: and if it may seem to any to be too large, they will easily discern it is not my fault (who have studied all possible brevity) but the copiousness of the Argument that occasioned it; but I must not make it longer by Apologies, and therefore having given this account of my own design, I will only make some few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Preface, and so pass to the Question it self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 1.</hi> He tells us, his Book <hi>is but a meer Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and the History of Tithes,</hi> yet <hi>p. 2.</hi> he saith, <hi>Antiquity is not related in it barely to shew what hath been, but to give light to the practice and doubts of the present Age;</hi> and <hi>p. 11.</hi> he confesses he hath drawn <hi>both Conclusions and Conjectures from his Premisses,</hi> which is somewhat more than a meer Narration; and indeed his partial argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all along for his private Opinion, shews him rather a Disputant for one side, than a Relator of Matter of Fact.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:95318:9"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 2.</hi> Where he is commending his own accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateness, and despising others, he cites <hi>Isidore Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leusiota</hi> wrong, both as to the place and the sense too, for <hi>Isidore</hi> makes not <hi>Habit</hi> and <hi>Beard</hi> the ensigns of dissembled Ignorance (as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> mistakes) but of dissembled Piety: and the place is (not <hi>lib. 1. Ep. 92.</hi> as in his first Edition, nor <hi>Ep. 29.</hi> as in his second; but) <hi>lib. 1. Ep. 220. p. 64.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 4.</hi> Those scoffing Censures of all that had writ about Tithes before Mr. <hi>S.</hi> look very odly from a young Man of <hi>33</hi> years of Age, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that the Reverend Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> the Learned Bishop <hi>Carleton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sclater,</hi> Sir <hi>James Sempil,</hi> and divers others had not long before writ on that Subject. And the Sectaries and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious Arguers against Tithes, who cites all that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> says on Trust, and having little in them, but what they steal from him and from one another, do much more deserve, to be compared to the later Poets licking up <hi>Homers</hi> vomit, and to be reflected on by that Proverb of <hi>Sardi venales,</hi> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies (not, worse and worse, as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> saith, but) a tedious row of the same thing over and over again, than those Great and Eminent defenders of the Divine right of Tithes before named.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 5.</hi> But the main thing observable in this Preface is, that he saith, <hi>It is a common, but most deceiving Argument among them</hi> (who writ of Tithes before Mr. <hi>S.) affirmatively to conclude fact or practice of Tithing, from what they see ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Tithes in any old Canon of the Church.</hi> Now if this be so deceiving an Argument, why doth Mr. <hi>S.</hi> himself use it<note n="(h)" place="margin">Review of <hi>4.</hi> Chap. p. <hi>463.</hi>
               </note>, when he concludes,
<pb facs="tcp:95318:9"/> fasting the last day of Lent till Cocks crow, must needs have followed, if the Constitution appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it had been extant; which is the same kind of arguing that he here condemns. But for my own part, I doubt not but this way of Arguing is fair and good; for when we enquire of Fact or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, we do not examine what are the Acts of the Impious and Profane, who despise the Laws of God and Man; but we enquire what is done by orderly and good Men, and surely their Practice may be concluded in point of Tithes, from what the Fathers preached in their Sermons and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in their Synods: for how slightly soever these are now esteemed by some, the Emperor <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> saith, <hi>They that keep the holy Canons, shall have the blessing of God; and those who disobey them, expose themselves to damnation</hi>
               <note n="(i)" place="margin">Justin. <hi>Novel.</hi> 123.</note>: And, <hi>All that is decreed in the holy Councils of Bishops, ought to be ascribed to the Divine Direction,</hi> saith Constantine<note n="(k)" place="margin">Epist. ad absent. Episc. in Actis Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. <hi>Nicaen.</hi>
               </note>, and the practice of Good men was generally conformable to them. And since the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of these Canons were the most Learned and eminent men in every Age, they shew at least what was the Opinion of those Times, what the best did, and what the wisest Persons thought all ought to do. Perhaps Mr. <hi>S.</hi> may find some Ill men in all Times who did not obey either the Laws of God or Man; but doth it therefore follow we must not cite the Canons, which were rules to good Men, and ought to have been so to all? We can bring Examples in every Age, of Facts contrary to the Decalogue, and to the justest Laws of the best Princes, yet still we cite these Laws, to shew
<pb facs="tcp:95318:10"/> what was the rule and the practice of the better sort. But while Mr. <hi>S.</hi> condemns this sort of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, he frequently falls into one far worse and more deceiving, for he argues from a few Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of some mens practice, that such Acts were right, and that all the Laws made against such practices were little observed; yea, if he can but find a Canon or a Decretal Epistle blaming any Fact as wicked, and forbidding it, presently he concludes the Laity had a challenged right to do those Acts, and upon this foundation are very many of his Notions built: but we can much easier prove Facts rightly done followed upon Canons duly made, than he can prove that the prohibition of any Fact shews the party prohibited had right to do the thing forbidden; for we have History and Examples to back all our old Canons with, which undeniably shews they were observed. 'Tis true, some of the later encroaching Popes Decretals were sometimes not allowed to be obeyed by wary Princes; but these Decretals are seldom cited by the Writers of Tithes before Mr. <hi>S.</hi> who hath more of these Quotations in one Chapter, than all the <hi>English</hi> Writers before him had in all their Books. And when he tells us, he will give In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Canons upon which no Fact followed, he instances chiefly in some Decretals: As that of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third to the Bishop of <hi>Lisieux,</hi> An. <hi>1160.</hi> about repairing Churches, which being to a private foreign Bishop, no wonder if it was not obeyed here<note n="(l)" place="margin">Decret. l. <hi>3.</hi> Tit. <hi>48.</hi> cap. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note>. His next instance is false cited; but in another place there is such a Decretal, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding Clergy-men to bequeath their Chattels<note n="(m)" place="margin">Ibid. Tit. <hi>26.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi>
               </note>;
<pb facs="tcp:95318:10"/> but this unjust Decree was contrary to the old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons<note n="(n)" place="margin">Apostol. Can. <hi>40.</hi> Concil. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochen.</hi> can. <hi>34.</hi>
               </note>, as well as to reason, and therefore no wonder if it were not obeyed here. And yet we might bring as many Civil Laws of our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which in that Age were over-ruled by the Canons of the Church, as he can produce Canons over-ruled by Civil Laws and Customs, of which exorbitant power of the Canons our own Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans often complain; but this is not to our purpose, for we lay most weight upon the Ancient and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Canons in the devouter Ages, and I hope we may conclude that practice followed them, whatever become of these Decretals. But he urges the <hi>12th</hi> Canon of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which only forbids private Bishops to seek the setting up of New Metropolitans, but doth not prohibit the Emperor from making such; and the like is to be said of the <hi>38th</hi> Canon in <hi>Trullo;</hi> and the <hi>55th</hi> Canon there was designed to impose an Eastern Custom on the Western Church, and so was not like to be observed. As for the <hi>15th</hi> Canon of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Balsamon</hi> saith not, it was never practiced, but that it was grown out of use in his time, nigh <hi>800</hi> years after. And the <hi>28th</hi> Canon of that Council did hold in the East (where it was made) for a long time, and was at last run down by the Popes power, not the Secular Law: and that of <hi>Bagadius</hi> (not <hi>Gabadius</hi>) in the Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> is only a Canon of one Council dispensed with by another, not repealed by Secular Law. So that in this heap of Marginal Quotations there is not one pertinent Instance, and after all we may well conclude from Ancient Canons never repealed in
<pb facs="tcp:95318:11"/> any other Synod, and confirmed by many Secular Laws that Practice followed, and this is all we shall desire in the case of Tithes. The rest of his Preface being answered in the Book, or nothing to the Question, I shall wave when I have noted, that <hi>pag. 21.</hi> he brings in an unjust Complaint in the Diet at <hi>Norimberg,</hi> An. <hi>1522,</hi> which had no effect, as if it were a Law that prevailed against the Canons of the Church, but the contrary may be seen in <hi>Wolfius</hi>

               </note>; this will give the Reader a Taste of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his way of citing Authors, of which there are innumerable Instances in the following Discourse.</p>
            <p>To which we had immediately proceeded, but only that there is lately Printed a New piece of <hi>Beneficiary Matters,</hi> translated (as is said) out of <hi>Italian,</hi> and pretended to be writ by Father <hi>Paul;</hi> but the Translator brings no proof it is his Work, and the Author of F. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Life, reciting all his Works saith, <hi>These are the Works of F.</hi> Paul, <hi>that are seen abroad in Manuscript or Print, under his only Name, or that are certainly reputed his</hi>

               </note>; but this Piece is not once named there, and so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be none of his: yet if it be, the <hi>Venetians</hi> Quarrel with the Pope about the Priviledges and Revenues of Ecclesiastics, might oblige that Great man to put some Notes hastily together in favour of the States pretences, and being a Fryer, he may well be supposed no Friend to the Divine Right of Tithes; but whoever was the Author, he was no doubt provoked by the notorious Abuse of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Revenues in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which most of this discourse is levelled: but

For we have here shewed, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Maintenance due to the Clergy by the Law of Nature, ought to be fixed in the Proportion of a Tenth part, because <hi>The Tenth</hi> was chosen by God himself at first, revealed to the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and commanded to the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Old Testament; the <hi>Tenth</hi> is not repealed, but established in the New. This Part was generally paid by <hi>Patriarchs, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> in all Ages and places. This Part is believed by the Fathers and best Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors to be due to the Gospel Ministers by the Law of God, and to them it hath been paid in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as well to Divine as Humane Laws in most Christian Countries, from their first Conversion. And here in <hi>England</hi> Tithes were freely paid from the beginning of Christianity, and above <hi>800</hi> years ago solemnly given by the whole Nation to God and the Church, by an irrevocable Vow recorded in a
<pb facs="tcp:95318:12"/> Public Law, and confirmed since by innumerable Civil and Ecclesiastical Constitutions; they have been all along enjoyed by the Clergy, and disposed of by their consent, and are now setled on them by firm Laws, by long Prescription, ancient Custom, and general Practice: so that they cannot be taken from them without the highest Injustice and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<note n="(t)" place="margin">Si vero is qui propria vota non reddit, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delis esse convincitur — quanto majoris im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietatis reus est, qui ea quae alii vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verunt &amp; reddiderunt usurpat. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gobardus de disp. cap.</hi> 12. <hi>pag.</hi> 279.</note>.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95318:17"/> set down as pleasing to God: from hence we may conclude, these Patriarchs had a command from Gods Spirit to give this proportion, though it be not written in <hi>Genesis.</hi> We read <hi>that Abraham obeyed Gods voice, and kept his Charge, his Commandements, his Statutes, and his Laws</hi>
                  <note n="(q)" place="margin">Gen. 26.25.</note>; but there are not so many recorded Orders of so different kinds from God to him as will answer to each of those words; unless we grant there were many unwritten Revelations, among which might be this of <hi>Tithes:</hi> The Law of putting an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteress</hi> to death, upon which <hi>Judah</hi> proceeded<note n="(r)" place="margin">Gen. 38.24.</note> is not on record before that practice, yet no doubt it was a Divine Revelation conveyed by Tradition since God confirmed it in the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95318:20"/> (as <hi>Abrahams</hi> Priest) a Sacrifice of <hi>Praise</hi> to the most High that gave them this Victory: And when we consider that <hi>Mamre,</hi> where <hi>Abraham</hi> dwelt, is (according to S. <hi>Hierom</hi>) but 22 <hi>Roman</hi> miles from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or about seven <hi>German</hi> miles by the Scale in <hi>Adricomius</hi>'s Mapps<note n="(k)" place="margin">Descrip. terrae S p. 341.</note>, so that a late Traveller saith, He went out in the Morning, viewed <hi>Hebron</hi> and all places of note thereabouts, and came back to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> at night<note n="(l)" place="margin">

All which makes it highly probable, that so Pious a man as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was, did ordinarily and regularly pay his Tithes to <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> and though it be recorded but once, yet we can no more infer from thence, that he only paid Tithes once, than we can that <hi>Melchisedec</hi> never blessed God but once, because it is mentioned but once in Scripture: Nor is it likely that <hi>Jacob</hi> should learn to dedicate the Tenth of all that he had, from <hi>Abrahams</hi> once only giving Tithe of Spoils, much less can we think the same of one single Act could have spread it self so generally over all the <hi>Gentile</hi> World (as shall be shewed in the Third Chapter,) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we conclude, that <hi>Abraham</hi> did frequently pay Tithes to <hi>Melchisedec:</hi> and because some do enquire, whether <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> did offer these Tithes as a free gift, or paid them as a Due, I shall observe, that <hi>Melchisedec</hi> was the Priest and the Representative of the Most high God, to whom the Tenth was peculiarly due, and therefore it may properly be said, he paid Tithes to <hi>Melchisedec</hi> as Gods due: and

               </p>
               <p n="5">§. V. It hugely confirms our former Assertion, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> paid Tithes of all frequently, because we find <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> who had been brought up according to the religious Rites of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, solemnly Vowing to give God the Tenth of all, which intimates that he had seen frequent dedications in that Proportion. God had appeared to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95318:21"/> him just now, and fixed all the Promises made to <hi>Abraham</hi> upon him and his Posterity, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxviii. 13, 14, &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon as he was now the heir of <hi>Abrahams</hi> blessings, he thought himself obliged to exercise <hi>Abrahams</hi> Piety, the sum of which is contained in the three branches of this Vow of <hi>Jacobs, viz.</hi> First, his Faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>Then shall the Lord be my God:</hi> Secondly, his Devotion, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>And this Stone which I have set for a Pillar shall be Gods House:</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his Gratitude, <hi>And of all that thou shalt give me, I will surely give the Tenth to thee.</hi> As the owning of the true God, and the dedicating a solemn place to his Worship, were derived from the known practice of <hi>Abraham,</hi> so was the consecrating the Tenth of all; and it is evidently grounded on the same reason, <hi>Abraham</hi> gave his Tenth to acknowledge, that <hi>God was the possessor of Heaven and Earth,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> gives his, because <hi>God is the giver of all that he hath;</hi> and this reason is not at all ceremonial or proper to the <hi>Jewish</hi> people, but moral and equally obliging to all that know God, if they have any estate by his bounty: And if the proportion had been arbitrary, 'tis likely <hi>Jacob</hi> would have varied and either given more or less; but his fixing on the same part, shews the Tenth part was determined before to belong to God. And since his present circumstances made him need and desire above all things to choose such a part as would be most pleasing and acceptable to God, no doubt he well knew that this was the proportion which was agreeable to Gods will, either by the special direction of the Spirit then, as Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> thinks<note n="(t)" place="margin">Non quod suo arbitrio Deum coluerit (scil. <hi>Dando decimas</hi>) nam directio Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitûs vice legis fuit. <hi>Calvin. in loc.</hi>
                  </note>, or rather by the practice and Tradition of his pious Ancestors, grounded upon a divine Revelation at first; but however he learned it, 'tis sure he knew this Part would please God, because he consecrates it on purpose to engage him to perform his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; and the Almighty abundantly proved <hi>Jacob</hi> was not mistaken, since he fully and liberally performed all that the good Man desired, and by giving him great plenty God did demonstrate to him and to all Mankind, that he liked and approved of the dedicating a Tenth part to his honour. And when God had thus enabled <hi>Jocob,</hi> upon his return
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95318:21"/> we need not question but he performed this Vow, and though the Scripture be silent, yet his Piety and the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of good Authors may assure us it was done. <hi>He paid it at his return by offering the Tithe of all his goods,</hi> saith <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi>

                     <hi>Joseph.</hi> Ant. l. 1. c. 18.</note>. <hi>He performed it in Bethel, and gave the Tithe of his substance for the honour of God, unto him that was in that Age to receive it,</hi> as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi>

                     <hi>Ab. Ezra</hi> in Gen. 35. &amp; <hi>Lyra, Tostatus, &amp;c.</hi> ibid.</note>. Who was the Chief Priest then is not certain, but Mr. <hi>S.</hi> thinks it very probable it was <hi>Isaac,</hi> who (as he truly affirms) was the Chiefest Priest at that time<note n="(x)" place="margin">Histor. p. 5.</note>; and for any thing appears in the Text, <hi>Jacob</hi> paid Tithes yearly after his return: for since God gave him not the increase of one year only, but of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year, and he had vowed to give God the Tenth of all that he should give him, therefore he who had every year new gifts, was obliged to acknowledge it by a new Tithing; and the Phrase in the Hebrew, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>Tithing, I will Tithe it to thee</hi> (which we translate, <hi>I will surely give the Tenth to thee</hi>) doth import frequency and exactness too in making of this Payment. Thus therefore we have a second Instance of another inspired Patriarch fixing on the Tenth part as fit to be offered and certainly pleasing God, and Gods own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of this Part, together with the payment of it to a Priest as God's Receiver, and great probabilities of constant and regular Tithing long before the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> But here the Jesuites, and Jesuited Sectaries object, <hi>That Jacobs Vow of Tithes was conditional, if God preserved him in his Journey, and gave him food and rayment, and brought him back in peace;</hi> which shews, <hi>that offering Tithes was no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary duty, nor would he have been obliged to it, if he had not bound himself thereto by Vow</hi>

                     <hi>Bellarm.</hi> Tom. 1. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trov. 5. l. 1. c. 25.</note>. To which I answer, that the conditions are absolutely necessary to the performance of the duty that he vowed, for unless his life were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and unless God gave him some Estate, how was it possible he should pay Tithes; so that these conditions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply no more, then that if he lived and had any thing, though never so small, though it were but Necessaries, out of that, whatever it were, more or less, he would give the Tenth to God: and the adding of such a condition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95318:22"/> which the duty vowed cannot possibly be performed, doth not prove the thing Vowed was no necessary duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Especially since it is very usual to Vow necessary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as when Holy Men vow to watch over their words, and to keep Gods Laws<note n="(b)" place="margin">Psal. xxxix. 1. &amp; cxix. 106. Nehem. x. 29. Jer. xxxiv. 8.</note>. Thus <hi>Hannah</hi> vowed her first-born Son to the Lord (due to him before by Express Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> xiii.) and upon such a condition as is mentioned in <hi>Jacobs</hi> vowing Tithes, <hi>viz.</hi> if the Lord would give her a Son<note n="(c)" place="margin">1 Sam.

S. <hi>Augustine</hi> doth highly commend our tying our selves to necessary duties by special Vow<note n="(d)" place="margin">Quid debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus vovere, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere in illum, sperare ab illo vitam aeternam, bene vivere, &amp;c. <hi>August.

                  </note>, and so do all practical Divines, and why then should it be strange that <hi>Jacob</hi> did so? But that which utterly baffles this Cavil is, that <hi>Jacob</hi> vows <hi>the Lord shall be his God,</hi> upon the same Conditions upon which he vows to give Tithes; and dare any say, <hi>It was no necessary duty before this Vow was made for Jacob to have the Lord for his God?</hi> If it were a necessary duty before this conditional Vow, then so might Tithes be also: And S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> explains these conditions to be rather manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Faith, than any limitations of his Vow, for God had just now promised to be with him, &amp;c. and though he had not yet actually performed them, yet <hi>Jacob</hi> was so assured of Gods truth, that out of a Heroic Trust in the Divine promises he presently engages himself to those Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which were the just acknowledgments of such Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and dedicates his Tithes before-hand, declaring thereby how much he loved and relied on God<note n="(e)" place="margin">

We conclude therefore, that the Patriarchs thought it a necessary duty to pay Tithes, and that their practice with the principles on which they proceeded are evident proof, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Tenth part was due to God, by sufficient mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festations of his Will, and therefore they paid it as due <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Divino.</hi>

The Hebrew Text <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> xxii. 29. <hi>Thou shalt not delay to offer thy fulness or abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi> is by the Vulgar rendred, <hi>Thou shalt not delay thy Tithes and First-fruits,</hi> and the <hi>Jewish</hi> Doctors expound it of <hi>Tithes</hi>

Now this Text evidently supposes they knew these to be due to God, so that the only thing to be done was to order them to pay them in due time and order. Again, when <hi>Moses</hi> is speaking of things Devoted to God already, so that they may not be alienated from him, nor redeemed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adding a fifth part to the Value, <hi>Levit.</hi> xxvii. 27. he adds, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. <hi>All the Tithe of the Land, whether of the Seed of the Land, or of the Fruit of the Tree, is the Lords;</hi> intimating that Tithe was then to be reckoned a devoted thing and due to God, before any Law had yet enjoyned the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and some think <hi>Jacobs</hi> Vow had so included his posterity, as to make Tithe a devoted thing to them; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95318:23"/> God promised to give him the Land which he gave to his posterity, and therefore his Vow might probably e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough include not only what God gave him in his own person, but in his posterity also. However, 'tis certain that here Tithes are claimed as Gods due <hi>by a most ancient Custom, of which no beginning appears,</hi> saith <hi>Grotius</hi> on the place; for indeed they had from the beginning of the World been reckoned as Gods part, and this claim was made soon after the coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and (as some do compute)<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Roberts</hi> Reven. of Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Ministers, p. 11.</note> 28 years before the assignation of Tithe to the <hi>Levites, Numb.</hi> xviii. 28. yet there also God supposes his right to the Tenth part to have been well known, and saith, <hi>I have given the Children of Levi all the Tenth in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi> He assigns his right, but doth not command the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all that Chapter. And when the Ceremonial dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (which were still later) were made, they rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the way and manner of paying Tithes under that Dispensation than enjoyn the thing it self, which shews there is no reason to account the <hi>Tenth</hi> to be originally a Ceremonial Institution. 'Tis true, while that Law conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, both the ancient Tithe which was assigned to the <hi>Levites,</hi> and the other two Tithes, were all due by Gods express written Law, as all do confess; there being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no doubt of that, we will under this period consider, 1. What was the method and order of <hi>Jewish</hi> Tithing; 2. How long this Law for it was observed; 3. How far the <hi>Jews</hi> Law or practice may concern Christians.</p>
               <p>First, For the <hi>Jewish</hi> manner of Tithing, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> saith, <hi>It was never fully taught by any Christian before his time, no not by the noble and learned</hi> Scaliger, <hi>though he undertook it in a single Treatise</hi>

                  <note n="(e)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. 2. §. 4. p. 17.</note>, as his own words are. We begin with <hi>First-fruits,</hi> which were of two sorts, <hi>Bicurim</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumah:</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:95318:23"/> the first called <hi>Bicurim</hi> Mr. <hi>S.</hi> saith <hi>were paid in Ears of Wheat, Barly, Figs, Grapes, Olives, Pomgranates and Dates,</hi> and of those seven only; and for this he cites three Texts, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxiii. 19. which mentions nothing of paying it in Ears; secondly <hi>Numb.</hi> xv. 20. which calls this very sort of First-fruits <hi>the Heave-offering of the Threshing floor;</hi> thirdly, <hi>Levit.</hi> xxiii. 10. where there is mention of an <hi>Omer,</hi> with which (<hi>R. Salomon</hi> observes) they measured this sort of First-fruit, implying it was threshed before it was paid: so that though the <hi>Bicurim</hi> were paid in Ears, these Texts do not prove it. Again, the <hi>Talmud</hi> saith, <hi>They set forth of First-fruits more the seven kinds</hi>

Secondly, The <hi>Theru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah</hi> or <hi>Heave-offering, Deut.</hi> xviii. 4. was paid next to the <hi>Bicurim,</hi> and this he truly notes (out of <hi>Scaliger</hi>) ought to be a 40th, 50th, or a 60th <hi>part,</hi> and he that offered no more than the <hi>sixtieth part</hi> was said to have <hi>an evil Eye,</hi> a Phrase which S. <hi>Matthew (Chap.</hi> xx. 15.) had not out of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> but out of the Old Testament<note n="(g)" place="margin">Prov. xxii 9. &amp; xxiii. 6.</note>; but we need not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquire into the manner of paying these, because they were not Tithes, only it suffices to note that both these sorts of <hi>First-fruits</hi> were paid before the Tithing.</p>

The <hi>Jewish</hi> Tithe Mr. <hi>S.</hi> divides into two sorts, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> had done before; but whereas <hi>Scaliger</hi> makes the Poor mans Tithe of the third year the same with the first Tithe, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> makes it the same with the second, or <hi>Tithe of Feasts;</hi> but it was truly a different kind from them both, and their Tithing is best divided into the first, second, and third Tithes.

I am the larger upon this distinction between the First and original Tenth part, and the other additional Ceremonies or Manners of tithing superadded by <hi>Moses</hi> Law, because it fully reconciles <hi>Origen,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and those other Fathers who expresly say Tithes were not Ceremonial, nor abrogated, to <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who are produced by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> to prove Tithes were Ceremonial; for <hi>Eusebius</hi> is plainly speaking of the second Tithe for Feasts paid at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which indeed is now ceased, and was purely Ceremonial, as was shewed before: and <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>

That is, if once they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that <hi>Levitical</hi> Curse still in force, then they must not only keep the Paschal Feast at the <hi>Jewish</hi> time, but in the <hi>Jewish</hi> manner also, with a Lamb, &amp;c. and not only observe one duty in the Ceremonial manner, but all others, <hi>viz.</hi> Circumsion, Tithing, and Offering at <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> but indeed that Curse is not in force, and so they are not bound to do any of those duties after the Ceremonial and <hi>Jewish</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; it is not therefore the Thing it self about which <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:95318:28"/> is discoursing, but the Ceremonial manner of doing it; for <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and they agreed, that a Paschal Feast was to be kept, but not at the <hi>Jewish</hi> time, nor in the Ceremonial manner; they agreed they were to offer, but not at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> so also they agreed Tithes were to be paid, but the Father only argues, that they were not bound to it by that <hi>Levitical</hi> Curse, and consequently not to Tithe in the Ceremonial manner: and since he saith, they agreed with the Church in all things else but the time of keeping <hi>Easter,</hi> we shall shew the Church then did receive Tithes, and therefore there was no difference about that, nor doth <hi>Epiphanius</hi> at all reckon Tithes as paid to Gospel Ministers among things abrogated.</p>
               <p>But, Secondly, though we do not claim Tithes by virtue of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, yet we learn many things from it which strengthen our right to Tithes now. <hi>First,</hi> This Law, and the practice upon it, declares Gods approbation of the Patriarchs choice of a Tenth part to be dedicated to his service, and testifies that his Ministers ought to be his Receivers; and the continuance of this payment during this Period, makes good the Clergies prescription against all others for near 2000 years together. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This provision for the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priesthood, was a pattern for Christ in providing for Gospel Ministers; for S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, As God the Father had appointed the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> should live of Tithes and Offerings, <hi>even so hath the Lord ordained, that they that preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel</hi>
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Cor. ix. 13, 14.</note>; intimating that our Lord followed that pattern, so that as theirs was a fixed certain honourable mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance chiefly in the proportion of a Tenth, so was ours to be also; and though not the same in all the Ceremonial and superadded circumstances, yet it was to be like it in the main, which it could not be if their maintenance were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and determined, and ours uncertain, arbitrary and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious; and thence also it would follow, that more care was taken of the old Priesthood than of the new, which serves to a better Covenant. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Law was also a Guide to the Primitive Christians, and taught them not to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95318:29"/> give less than a Tenth to their Ministers, not by any direct obligatory power believed to be in this Law, but <hi>per vim ejus exemplarem</hi> (as the Schoolmen speak) by analogy and parity of reason: for if a meaner Priesthood had Tithes for its provision, surely a better Priesthood ought not to have less; hence the Fathers say, <hi>We that have a better hope ought chearfully to give rather more than less</hi>

                     <hi>Origen</hi> in Numb. hom. xii.</note>. And this is the true reason why the Ancients frequently cite the Precepts, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and Threatnings of the Old Testament concerning Tithes, and apply them to Christians; not (as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> often suggests) that they believe the <hi>Levitical</hi> Precepts obligatory directly to us, but that we are by parity of reason obliged not to give less; and if we be as bountiful as they were, we may expect the blessings promised to them, if not, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to suffer severe punishments for our covetousness and impiety. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We learn from the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, that Christians received great ease by the coming of Christ even in this point also, though the full Tenth part be paid still, because Christ hath abrogated all that was brought in by the Ceremonial Law, and reduced us to the Original pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion used among the Patriarchs, whereas the <hi>Jews</hi> paid some years thrice as much as we do. We are now free from the second and third Tithe, from the reserved Corner, the offering of First-fruits, redeeming our First-born of Man and Beast, and from many other payments to which they were bound; and yet they discharged all these dues freely (as <hi>Philo</hi> and S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> tell us)<note n="(i)" place="margin">

Tom. 6. p. 897.</note>, never repining or envying at the riches of their Clergy, who lived (on this maintenance of Gods own designing) almost in the state of Princes, so that if any now do murmur to give not half so much to a better Ministry, under which they have better Ordinances and more useful Means of Grace, they discover
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95318:29"/> a sordid Mind, and a great contempt of the holy Gospel. Finally, The Institution of a Tenth part coming from God at first, and being practiced by inspired and holy Patriarchs before the Law, being approved by God, established by the Law, and settled by a long prescription under the <hi>Jewish</hi> dispensation, and there being no declaration, that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to repeal this proportion, this alone (if there were no more) is sufficient to oblige Christians to dedicate their Tithes for the maintenance of the Gospel Ministry, nor could they be excused from covetousness and disregard to Gods Service, if they should have given a less proportion.</p>

In the relation of this Custom Mr. <hi>S.</hi> hath indeed observed many Instances, but yet he shews great partiality in striving to make it seem as narrow as he can; and besides his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes in the passages he cites, he omits very many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, both which shall here be rectified and supplied. We begin with the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> among whom <hi>Melchisedec</hi> was both a Prince and a Priest, and used to receive Tithes, so
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95318:30"/> that we may be sure Tithing was very ancient there, for the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> (who were a Colony of <hi>Phoenicians</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into <hi>Africa</hi> about 900 years after the death of <hi>Sem, A.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95318:37"/> custom of the place directed, and to them they paid Tithes, though we see sometimes they were paid to the Gods in general, to whom they believed the Tenth part to be due. Having thus fully shewed the Heathens use of Tithing, before I conclude, let me here produce some reasons to prove, that this Custom was derived from some of the first Patriarchs, and not from the <hi>Jews.</hi> First▪ The Antiquity and extent of Tithes among them, which was a Law in <hi>Greece,</hi> almost as soon as <hi>Moses</hi> made it so to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and spread it self over <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> yea even to the barbarous Northern Nations, who had no knowledge of the <hi>Jews</hi>

                     <hi>Seld.</hi> hist. cap. 10. §. 1. p. 269.</note>; and wherever the <hi>Gentiles</hi> paid them, they did it only in One Tenth part, as the Patriachs did of old, and the Christians do now, not with any of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial appendages. Secondly, The <hi>Gentiles</hi> also gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rally paid Tithe of Spoils, which the <hi>Jews</hi> never did, and that shews their practice was derived from <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> not from the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> which will still be plainer if we note (what is not commonly observed, <hi>viz.</hi>) Thirdly, The <hi>Gentiles</hi> often paid Tithes to their Kings or Chief Magistrate, a custom that is plainly derived from <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> who was (as all Kings of old were) both King and Priest, and while the Professions were united in one person he had Tithes, but when the Professions were sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, the King in some places irregularly took them to himself. So it was in <hi>Italy</hi> till <hi>Evanders</hi> time, when <hi>Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caranus</hi> took them off from giving Tithes to the King, and bid them give them to the Gods. Thus also Tithes had been paid to the chief Magistrate at <hi>Athens</hi> before <hi>Pisistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> time, as his Letter to <hi>Solon</hi> shews; and <hi>Demosthenes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members that the State had Tithe of all Wares which passed the <hi>Hellespont.

Leaving Mr. <hi>S.</hi> therefore for a while, we observe that when the Ceremonial Law ceased, the Priesthood (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> informs us) was not ended, but changed<note n="(a)" place="margin">Hebrews vii. 12.</note> for a better; the Blessed Jesus instituted his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles Ministers of the New Testament, and gave them power and directions to constitute others to succeed them to the end of the World: And since this Ministry was to be managed by Men who would need a Maintenance, we cannot doubt but our Lord would provide for them; which also the greatest Enemies of Tithes grant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that Christ hath in the Gospel established a Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in general for this Ministry, so that a competency for their subsistence is due to them <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> The only Question is, Whether the old Proportion of a Tenth be now due to the Gospel Ministry by the Law of God? We think it is, and that for these Reasons.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:95318:39"/>
               <p>First, Because there is no express repeal of Tithes in the New Testament, and they were due by Gods Law before, therefore they must continue to be due so still, unless some evident repeal can be produced. And there is more reason to expect an express repeal of this Tenth part by name than by any other thing, because that proportion was fixed so early and had stood so long; it began by Divine dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, continued by Gods approbation and positive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, it was consented to and practiced all the World o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, so that the Blessed Jesus might expect that both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> upon their conversion, would certainly give this old, known, and customary Proportion to the Gospel Ministry, unless he forbid it in express terms, which he would certainly have done if he intended Tithes should have ceased. Though all that was Ceremonial be ceased, yet who could think that a bare Number, that is no type of any thing to come, that was in use before the Ceremonial Law, and a proportion paid to that very Priesthood of which Christ was, that this number should be either Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial or ceased. There is an express repeal of all Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial things done by the Patriarchs, bloody Sacrifices and Circumcision are abrogated by name in the Gospel, but so are not Tithes, and therefore they are not Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial. 'Tis true, all <hi>Levitical</hi> Ceremonies are not repealed by name, but divers are, and the rest are such as were so appropriate to the Temple and <hi>Jewish</hi> Priesthood, that the destruction of the Temple and changing that Priesthood rendred them unpracticable, and made them cease of themselves; but paying of a Tenth to the Ministry is as practicable now as ever. The Ceremonial appendages in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed appropriate to that Priesthood and Worship ceased with them without any repeal; but the more ancient and Universal proportion of a Tenth that had suited <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedecs</hi> Priesthood as well as <hi>Aarons,</hi> and was needed and deserved by the Gospel Ministers now, this could not cease without an express repeal, and since there is no repeal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, we may conclude Christ intended it should stand. We Christians are sure God directed and approved it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95318:39"/> the Law, and enjoyned it under the Law; we know he once liked this part, and therefore unless we have as plain proof he doth not like it now, we ought to give this Part still, nothing but an express repeal being sufficient to assure us that God hath changed his mind in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. But though there be such reason to expect a positive Text to repeal this Tenth part, the opposers of Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Tithes can produce nothing but that place of S. <hi>Paul, Hebr.</hi> vii. 12. <hi>For the Priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the Law;</hi> and this they would have (against all sense and reason) to imply a change of the Law for paying Tithes. But the scope of the Apostles dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course in that Chapter, and the Contexts also do utterly confute that forced and false Interpretation: for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle is there shewing, that Tithes belonged to <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decs</hi> Priesthood, of which Order Christ himself is; yea, he proves <hi>Melchisedec</hi> was a Priest by his receiving Tithes, and his Order better than <hi>Aarons,</hi> because his Tithing was more excellent. Now since all this tends to prove Christs Priesthood better than <hi>Aarons,</hi> would it not be very strange if in that very Chapter S. <hi>Paul</hi> should say, the Gospel Priesthood had no Tithes at all, might not the <hi>Jews</hi> have told him that he (who before argued <hi>Melchisedecs</hi> Order to be better than <hi>Aarons</hi> from the Tithing annexed) now proved this new Priesthood either not to be of <hi>Melchisedecs</hi> Order, or not to be so good as that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> being wholly stript of Tithes; but if we look at the Verses before and after, we shall see S. <hi>Paul</hi> is not speaking of any change of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law in the point of Tithes, but in the point of Succession; he only speaks here of the repeal of that branch of the Law which confined the Priesthood to the Tribe of <hi>Levi.</hi> He had shewed, that God intended to change the Priesthood for a better, and had spoken in the <hi>Psalms</hi> of another Priest to arise after the Order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedec,</hi> which Priest S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms was the Blessed Jesus, who indeed was not of <hi>Aarons</hi> Order, nor descended of that Tribe; but that was no hindrance to his being a Priest to this new Order, in regard it was plain God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95318:40"/> to abrogate that old Order of confining the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> ver. 11. <hi>For if that Levitical Priesthood had been perfect, and to endure for ever, why should not David have spoken of a new Priest of the Order of Aaron? why doth he say, he shall be of the Order of Melchisedec? (whose descent is not reckoned as the Levitical Priests were.) This shews the Priesthood was not to be confined to the Tribe of Levi any longer; and though the Law of Moses had so appointed, yet Gods choosing a New Priest of another Order, shews that branch of the Law is abrogated,</hi> (and then comes in these words) <hi>For there being a change of the Priesthood, there is made of necessity a change also of the Law,</hi> ver. 12. that is, in the point of fixing the Priesthood to one Family, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>For he of whom these things are spoken</hi> (that is, Christ Jesus) <hi>pertaineth to another Tribe of which no Man gave attendance at the Altar.</hi> Ver. 14. <hi>For it is evident our Lord sprang out of Juda, of which Tribe Moses spake nothing concerning the Priesthood.</hi> This being the plain words and sense of the Apostle, I appeal to any man that will impartially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the place, if it be not impudently done to force this Text (which speaks of quite another matter) to come in as a repeal of Tithes,; if it were (as some have unwarily expounded it) a repeal of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law in general, it could only be extended to what was Ceremonial in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Tithing, but could not at all have touched the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Tenth part which had nothing Ceremonial in it. We conclude therefore, that since there is no express repeal of Tithes in the New Testament, it follows that Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they should stand and remain still due by Divine right, as they had always been reputed before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Besides this Negative Argument there are many probable and positive evidences, that it is our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours will Tithes should be paid to Gospel Ministers. Those which make it probable are: First, That when Christ is comparing Moral Duties and Tithes together, he saith, <hi>These things ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> xxiii. 23.</note>, implying that those great Moral duties are so to be taken care of, that we do not omit to give Tithes,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95318:40"/> which being contributed to the maintenance of Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice it is an act of Righteousness and Piety to pay Tithes strictly even of the least matter; and since Christ said the <hi>Pharisees ought to do this act of Righteousness,</hi> no doubt we Christians ought to do it also, because our Righteousness must exceed theirs; thus many of the Fathers argue<note n="(c)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Origen</hi> in Numer. hom. 11. <hi>Hilar.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos. in S. Math. p. 355. <hi>August.</hi> in Psal. 146. <hi>Agobardus</hi> de disp. rei Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. pag. 277.</note>. Secondly, Whereas S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>The Presbyters who labour in the Word and Doctrine, are worthy of double honour</hi>
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Tim. iv. 17.</note>. He clearly alludes to the Elder brothers portion, which was double<note n="(e)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> xxi. 17.</note>. And whereas the Elder brothers were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the Priests of every Family, and had besides their own share of the Inheritance, the Tithes of all their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns parts annexed to their Primogeniture, which made their Portion to be double; thence we may infer, that the Gospel Ministers succeeding those Elder brothers in their Office, ought to succeed them in the reward also, and are worthy of Tithes, as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> seems to have understood this place, because he quotes it to prove that Gospel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters have a right to Tithes<note n="(f)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hieron.</hi> com. in Mal. 3. Tom. 5. p. 642.</note>. Thirdly, The same A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle requires the Clergy should <hi>be given to Hospitality</hi>
                  <note n="(g)" place="margin">1 Tim. iii. 2.</note>, which doth require a certain and a large Proportion to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, and yet the Ministers are forbid by Scripture<note n="(h)" place="margin">2 Tim. iv. 4.</note>, and by the Canons of the Church also<note n="(i)" place="margin">Apostol. Can. vi.lxxxi, lxxiii. Concil. <hi>Chalced.</hi> Can. III, &amp;c.</note>, to use any other Trade to get mony, and are enjoyned to give themselves wholly to their Ministry, and to attend continually upon it<note n="(k)" place="margin">1 Tim iv. 15.</note>, so that they have neither time nor means allowed to procure wherewithal to be hospitable, and yet God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires they should be given to Hospitality; whence we may infer, that he who lays this injunction on them, hath at least allowed them the old proportion of a <hi>Tenth,</hi> to enable them to do what he requires of them. Fourthly, The 7th Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> hath many intimations that Tithes do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Christs Priesthood, and consequently to those that are his Representatives on the Earth: for S. <hi>Paul</hi> there proves they belonged to the Priesthood of <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> v. 2. yea he proves him a Priest by this <hi>Medium,</hi> because he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Tithes, and <hi>ver.</hi> 8. he uses the phrase of <hi>them that receive Tithes,</hi> for <hi>them that are Priests.</hi> He is shewing, <hi>that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95318:41"/> here men that die are Priests,</hi> but he expresseth it thus, <hi>here men that die receive Tithes;</hi> to intimate to us, that Tithes are inseparable from a Priesthood, and in that very Verse S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Tithing <hi>he received them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth,</hi> that is plainly Christ himself (of whom the <hi>Psalms</hi> witness that he liveth, because they say <hi>he was a Priest for ever,</hi>) He it was who received <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Tithe; so that as <hi>Levi</hi> paid Tithes in <hi>Abraham,</hi> v. 9. so Christ received Tithes in and by his type <hi>Melchisedec.</hi> Wherefore since Christ himself, by virtue of his Priesthood did actually receive Tithes, no doubt his right to them is assigned to those who succeed him on Earth, that is, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Ministry, whose right to Tithes Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> undertakes to prove from this very place<note n="(l)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Reynolds</hi> on Psal. cx. 4. pag. 474, &amp;c.</note>. And truly no man can justly call these Patriarchal and Evangelical Tithes, <hi>abolished Ceremonies,</hi> or count them improper for the Gospel Ministers, since the Priesthood of <hi>Melchisedes</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> that were neither temporary nor ceremonial, had Tithes annexed to them. But not to insist largely on these probable proofs, we have Two plain Texts which prove, that Jesus Christ hath ordained Tithes shall stand: The first is that place which <hi>Origen</hi> brings in his Homily on <hi>Numbers,</hi> to prove that Tithes are still due to the Gospel Ministry, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 13, 14. where S. <hi>Paul,</hi> though he took no maintenance of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> yet he largely proves his right to it, First, by divers parallel cases of a <hi>Souldier, Vine-dresser,</hi> a <hi>Shepheard,</hi> ver. 7. Secondly, By the Moral sense of that <hi>Levitical</hi> Priesthood, of not <hi>muzling the Ox,</hi> ver. 8, 9, 10. Thirdly, From the excellency of his work among them, which afforded them things far more worth than the biggest proportion of their worldly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. Fourthly, From the practice of other Teachers, who had taken maintenance of them as a due, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. But the chief Argument of all urged by S. <hi>Paul</hi> for his right, is the positive Ordinance of God the Father for the Old Testament, and of our Lord Jesus for the New, <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14. <hi>Do ye not know</hi> (saith he) <hi>that they which minister about holy things, live of the things of the Temple,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95318:41"/> and they that wait at the Altar are partakers with the Altar: EVEN SO HATH THE LORD ORDAINED that they which preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel:</hi> Where we see he urges God's care of the old Priesthood as a Pattern which Christ had imitated in the New. Then (by God's ordaining) the <hi>Levites</hi> or Ministers of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple lived <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of the Holy portion, or (as we read) of the things of the Temple, that is, of <hi>Tithes,</hi> and the Priests or Waiters on the Altar did share with the Altar, and had their part of offerings made there: Even so hath Christ ordained in the New Testament, that his Ministers shall live of the rewards given them for preaching the Gospel<note n="(m)" place="margin">

                  </gap>) ordained even such a like main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanance for his Ministers; not the same in all points (for it differs in the Ceremonies superadded to it in <hi>Moses</hi> Law,) but very like it in the main, like it in the Authority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, the certainty, the proportion, &amp;c. that is, a <hi>Tenth part;</hi> and if our Lord had left our maintenance precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, arbitrary, and unsettled, so that the People might have given more or less, something or nothing, as they pleased, how could it be said he had ordained even such a Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as was under the Law, when there would have been no likeness at all between them, no more than is between fixt and unfixt, certain and uncertain, or between a good provision and a bad: and it will make the Apostles words to be no sense, if we do not understand him of a likeness between the Evangelical and Legal maintenance. As God ordained a certain fixed liberal provision for the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priesthood, even so hath Christ ordained, that his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters shall live of whatever men will give them; 'tis plain there would be no consequence in that Exposition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we conclude, that Christ ordained a certain mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95318:42"/> for his Ministers, and because his Pattern was the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, it must be a Tenth part at least. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Primitive Christians did believe it was Christs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance they should dedicate Tithes, because as soon and as often as they could they offered Tithes as the just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Gospel, and their practice is the best commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary on this figurative expression; they knew the Tenth had always been reputed Gods part, and every where paid to his Ministers, and hearing Christ had ordained a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision like to that under the Law for his Ministers, they easily understood he meant it of Tithes, and accordingly dedicated them to be the Gospel maintenance, and of this now do we Live according to Christs special Ordinance. But some will ask, <hi>Where did Christ ordain this?</hi> I reply, We have the Holy Ghosts witness he did ordain it, and therefore though we could not tell where, yet it is sure there was such an Ordinance delivered by Christ, but whether it were some former Order of Christ conveyed to S. <hi>Paul</hi> by unwritten Tradition (as that <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 35.) or it was a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial revelation to this Apostle now first written down, yet to us it is a Divine Law. And since Christ hath ordained we shall live upon a certain fixed liberal proportion, like unto that which the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priests had for the main, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that this cannot be less than a Tenth; so much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is due to us by Christs own Ordinance, i. e. <hi>Jure Divino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The same Apostle hath another express Law for Ministers maintenance in these words, <hi>Let him that is taught in the word, communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things</hi>
                  <note n="(n)" place="margin">Gal. vi. 6.</note>, or as <hi>Beza</hi> in his notes doth explain it, <hi>Ex om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus bonis suis, Let him give him a part of all his goods or good things,</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> both here and elsewhere signifies our <hi>Worldly goods</hi>
                  <note n="(o)" place="margin">Luke xii. 19. &amp; Chap. xvi. 25.</note>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> imports our <hi>giving</hi> of our goods to others, so as they may have a part and share of them<note n="(p)" place="margin">Rom. xii. 13. Phil. iv. 15.</note>. The sense of this part therefore is, That Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians must not take and enjoy all their Worldly goods themselves. A Part of them all, a share of every kind of their Worldly goods must be set apart for their Minister, and freely communicated to him, so that he may partake
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95318:42"/> with us in all: So that by the letter of this Law, those Christians who have Corn, Hay, Wool, increase of Flocks and Herds, or any other Worldly goods, are bound to give the Minister a part of all these; and though the Tenth be not named to avoid giving of offence to the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet no question that Part is meant, because it was so well known, and so universally believed then by <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God, and it was superfluous to name it, when it would give offence so to do; since this ever was the Part and no other; this Part God had chosen and approved, and never shewed any dislike of it, nor had he substituted any other in the room of it, this Part had good evidence of Gods liking; and therefore when Good men would give some part (and must fix upon a proportion before they could give) no doubt they would choose that part which they had most assurance would please God, and if so, they must give a Tenth part; and we shall see presently, that when the Primitive Christians came to limit the Apostles indefinite expression by giving in a fixed proportion, <hi>They did give Tithes.</hi> That proportion was fixed and known, generally used all the World over, and had been from the beginning, before this Law of giving part of all our Goods to the Ministers was made, and therefore that proportion was intended in this Law; and when this Precept was to be reduced to act, this Proportion was the limitation thereof. Only there is by this general expression liberty left to give more (which includes a <hi>Tenth</hi>) but not to give less; and to encourage us rather to exceed than fall short of this known proportion, S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in the two next Verses, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, and 8. that to spend all our goods without giving the Priest his part, is to mock God, and provoke him to withhold all Gospel blessings from us; and if we be so wicked as to spend all upon our selves in providing for the flesh, all that we can expect is that we and our Estates shall perish together, our flesh, and the provision laid out upon it shall turn into corruption; but what we give to the Ministers is sowed to the Spirit, laid out for our Souls good, and for that we so bestow we shall have everlasting
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95318:43"/> life. Which are strong Arguments to engage us to give a large Part to our Ministers, because that part of our goods only is disposed of for the advantage of our Souls here and hereafter: this Precept therefore with the inference upon it is a clearer proof out of the New Testament, that God requires Christians to give at least a Tenth part of all their goods to his Ministers, to whom therefore this part is due <hi>Jure divino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that we may do right to those of the contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, before we conclude this discourse we will mention their Main Objections, which are Three. <hi>First,</hi> They say, <hi>Neither Christ nor his Apostles received Tithes.</hi> To which I Answer, That our Lord Jesus was <hi>made under the Law,</hi> Gal. iv. 4. and was always obedient to it, since it was in full force during his life. Now the Law had then fixed Tithes upon the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> to which Tribe our Saviour did not belong, and therefore he had broken the Law if he had claimed or received Tithes then; yet we have proved out of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that Tithes did belong to his Priesthood, though the time in which he lived would not permit him to exercise that right. As for the Apostls, their unfixed state of life was such, that neither could Believers pay them regularly, nor they receive them; and besides they were very tender of giving offence to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Priesthood who yet were in possession of them, nor had they any need to anger the <hi>Levites</hi> by claiming or receiving them, since they were plentifully provided for other ways, by some Christians selling all, and giving them the Mony to dispose of, and by the liberal Contributions that others made to them. Yet we see they did declare, they had by Christs Ordinance a right to such a kind of maintenance as the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> of old had by Gods Law, and that Believers ought to give the Ministers a part of all their goods; but as it was no prejudice to the <hi>Levites</hi> title, that no Tithes were paid in the Wilderness to <hi>Aaron</hi> or the rest of that Ministry: so it is no prejudice to our Claim, that Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles in the unsettled state of the Church took no Tithe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They object, <hi>That Christ hath expresly set down
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95318:43"/> Meat and Drink for the maintenance of his Ministers</hi>
                  <note n="(q)" place="margin">Math. x. 9. &amp; Luke x. 6, 7, 8, 9.</note>, <hi>and therefore did not intend they should have Tithes.</hi> I reply, If Meat and Drink comprehend all necessary conveniences of humane life suitable to a Ministers office, then Tithe may well stand, because that proportion where it is paid seldom affords more. But indeed these Texts are grosly mistaken, for they are special directions given by Christ only with respect to that particular Embassy on which he was then sending his Disciples, not general or standing Laws for the Church afterwards; <hi>These Commands</hi> (saith S. <hi>Chrysostom) were temporary, and not to continue always</hi>
                  <note n="(r)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Chrysost.</hi> hom. Tom. 6, pag. 896.</note>, which appears in that Shoes are forbidden here, and upper Garments, &amp;c. which yet we see these Apostles used with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out scruple afterward<note n="(s)" place="margin">Acts xii. 8. &amp; 2 Tim. iv. 13.</note>; and if these Commands were still in force, no Minister might have any Mony in his purse, or two Cotes on his back, Shoes on his feet, or a Staff in his hand: but indeed these Precepts are now void, and were as soon as that message was over; and therefore the Apostles took more than bare meat and drink, which they would not have done against their Masters positive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, if it had not been out of date. Meat and Drink was all they were to take of unconverted persons in this first Message; but <hi>we must not think</hi> (saith <hi>Calvin) there is a standing Law prescribed to all Ministers, while the Lord is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the first Preachers of his Doctrine what they were to do for a while, which piece of Ignorance hath so far deceived many, that they would reduce all Ministers without distinction to this Rule</hi>

                     <hi>Calvin.</hi> Harm. Evang. in loc. p. 218.</note>. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Their great Objection is, <hi>That the name of Tithes is not found in any command of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> To which I reply, That the Articles of our Church say, <hi>We are to receive, not only whatever is read in Scripture, but what may be proved thereby</hi>
                  <note n="(u)" place="margin">Art. xxxix. art. 6.</note>; and when the <hi>Arrians</hi> objected to the Orthodox Fathers, that the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, was not found in Scripture, and upon that pretence denied Christ to be of the same substance with his Father; The Orthodox answered the sense of that word was in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and might be proved by fair consequences, and therefore the thing was to be believed, though the word
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95318:44"/> was not there; and we say the very same concerning Tithes. And further, we can give good reasons why Tithes were not named in the New Testament, though Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they should stand: <hi>First,</hi> To avoid giving offence to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and take from them all occasion of traducing this new Religion, as if the design of it was only to spoil their Priests of their Temporalties. The Apostles were always tender towards the <hi>Jews,</hi> and lest they should hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Conversion, they complied so far as to observe some abolished Ceremonies<note n="(w)" place="margin">Act. xvi. 3. Chap. xxi. 14. Galat. II. 11, 12, 13.</note>; and 'tis thought S. <hi>Paul</hi> conceals his name in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> because he was there to prove the Legal Priesthood and Sacrifices were abolished. And this reason alone might cause the Writers of the New Testament to forbear the name of <hi>Tithes</hi> as due to Gospel Ministers, lest they should exasperate the <hi>Jewish</hi> Priesthood, which then was in actual possession of them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It was needless to name <hi>Tithes</hi> in the New Testament, because they stood firm enough upon their old foundation, Gods directing this part before the Law, his enjoyning it in the Law, and never repealing it, this with the practice of the Patriarchs, the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in all Nations (where the Gospel was to be preached) for above 2000 years, had settled it so well before, that it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no new establishment, some general intimations, that the Apostles were Gods Ministers, and were to have that part which belonged to God, that part of all our Goods was to be given to them, and that Christ had ordained them a maintenance suitable to that of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, was enough to make all Nations understand that the Tenth was now to be given to Gospel Ministers, and they did actually give it upon these general directions, which they took for express Laws to give Tithes. And thus it was also in the parallel case of the Sabbath, which is a Seventh part of our time dedicated to God, as Tithes are a Tenth of our Estates. All sober Christians do generally believe Christ intended this Seventh part of our time should remain still dedicated to God, as to the main; yet there is no express Law for it in the New Testament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95318:44"/> it was well settled before, by Gods Law and a long practice upon it. There were indeed some Ceremonies su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded under <hi>Moses</hi> (as also there were in Tithes) to be pared off; but the proportion, the certainty, and end of keeping it were to remain, because the reason of the thing continued, <hi>viz.</hi> that God was still to be worshipped at one certain time in publick, and God had never declared any dislike of the proportion chosen of old; and therefore this stands still, and no doubt by Christ's will and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though he made no new Law expresly for it: And so also doth the payment of Tithes, which with the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath being well settled before, our Lord did not think it necessary to make any New express Law for either of them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The naming <hi>Tithes</hi> might be forborn in the New Testament, because the Christians of that Age could not possibly pay them, nor yet the Apostles receive them, so that there was no occasion to name them then, and Jesus foresaw that enough was said to move Christians to pay them as soon as the Church was settled, which was as soon as there was need of them; and therefore though he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Tithes should stand in force, yet he might justly forbear express mention of them. <hi>Lastly,</hi> It was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to name <hi>Tithes</hi> in the New Testament, because Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers did freely give more than a Tenth to God and his Ministers; <hi>Many of them then sold all that they had, and gave the price to the Apostles</hi>
                  <note n="(x)" place="margin">Act. iv, &amp; v.</note>. And the Records of the first Ages shew that their bounty was very great, insomuch that the Clergy was maintained nobly, and envied by many for their abundance, as both Heathen and Christian Authors shew<note n="(y)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ammian. Marcellin.</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> ap. <hi>Seld.</hi> review pag. 462.</note>; so that as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> speaks, <hi>It had been to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to have had Tithes of annual increase paid</hi> (or named, say I) <hi>while that most bountiful devotion of good Christians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in frequent oblations both of Lands and Goods to such value.</hi> Seld. <hi>Review, p.</hi> 462. To enjoyn a Tenth then had been to check the liberality of those pious Ages, and was as needless, as it is to enjoyn him to keep the Sabbath, who spends every day wholly in Devotion. The Tenth was then esteemed but the least and lowest measure of Christian
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95318:45"/> Oblations, a pitch to which the <hi>Jews</hi> arrived; but that Age thought Christians, who had a better Priesthood, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ordinances, and better Promises, were obliged to give more, and actually did so, so that to command the Tenth expresly was needless, since Jesus foresaw his Devout Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes would give more. And this may suffice to shew, why Christ did not enjoyn <hi>Tithes</hi> by name in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, although there be sufficient evidence that he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that Proportion should stand, which therefore was believed by the Primitive Christians to be due to Gospel Ministers <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> as we shall go on to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</p>
               <p n="2">§. II. If the Inferences from the forecited Texts seem not so clear to any, the Opinion and Practice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church may satisfie them that we have rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded them; for those Ancients who lived so near the Apostles, and had conversed with such as had seen them alive, having also many of their Traditions as yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncorrupted among them, are most likely to know what their Meaning was in this case. Wherefore we will now enquire into their Judgment and Practice concerning Tithes, and that we may follow Mr. <hi>S.</hi> more closely, we shall observe his division of the Time since our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Four times four hundred years, only where he hath taken off any Testimony from the preceding four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years and added it to the next following (as he often doth, to make the Evidence seem less and later than it is) there we shall put them in their true place, and particularly we must reduce the Testimonies of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> (which he throws back into the next Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter) to this first four hundred years, in which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> had no mind to have them seen, because he had laid down these false Positions in the entrance to this Chapter, <hi>viz.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95318:45"/> the Church, it is not to be expected there should be any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular payment of Tithes till toward the end of this Period, because the Church was under Persecution for nigh 320 of this 400 years, and yet even under the Persecution the Christians did give their Clergy more than a Tenth part, which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> himself confesses, saying, <hi>So liberal in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Christianity was the Devotion of the Believers, that their bounty to the Evangelical Priesthood far exceeded what the Tenth could have been</hi>

Upon which ground we may affirm, that even where Christians had sold all their Patrimonies and

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95318:46"/> Orders should not be taken off from Divine administration, nor be intangled with secular things, but remaining in the honour of</hi> Sportulantes fratres, <hi>receiving as it were Tithe of Fruits, might never be taken off from the Altar and Sacrifices,</hi> Ep. 34. I cannot see how Mr. <hi>S.</hi> can conclude from hence, <hi>That no payment of Tithes was in use in his time.</hi> For if we consider the place, it will appear he saith, the maintenance of the Gospel Clergy was like to that of the <hi>Levites,</hi> only with this difference, that whereas the <hi>Levites</hi> had Tithe of Fruits from the People, the Clergy had their <hi>Sportulae</hi> from the Bishop, which was <hi>Tanquam decimas ex fructibus,</hi> in lieu of Tithes, and as it were Tithe of Fruits, which implies, that the Bishops did then really receive <hi>Decimas ex fructibus,</hi> Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Fruits in the proportion of a Tenth (as we shall shew more fully presently) out of which they distributed a portion as large as Tithes would have been to the inferiour Clergy, which was <hi>tanquam Decimas.</hi> And unless Mr. <hi>S.</hi> could prove, that the oblations of Fruits made to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop was not in the proportion of a Tenth; he cannot infer from this place <hi>There was no use of Tithes in</hi> Cyprians <hi>time.</hi> It is plain that the proportion was so large as to maintain the Ministry liberally without minding Secular things, and that may convince us that the Oblations were a Tenth at least; and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, it was proportionable to the <hi>Levites</hi> Tithe, only not paid to the inferiour Clergy by the People. Again, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> commends the bounty of former times, when they sold Houses and Lands, and thence justly blames those of his own time, <hi>who did not so much as give Tithes out of their Patrimony</hi>
                  <note n="(u)" place="margin">Domos tunc &amp; fundos ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nundabant, at nunc patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio nec decimas damus, <hi>Cypr. de unit Eccles. §. 23.</hi>
                  </note>; which shews he accounted it a fault and blame-worthy, not to give Tithes. But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> contrary to all Grammar and common Sense, would have <hi>Patrimonio decimas damus,</hi> to signifie, <hi>We give the Tenth part of our Land,</hi> but then it must have been <hi>Decimam partem Patrimonii;</hi> and since the words are <hi>Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Patrimonio,</hi> nothing can be plainer than that he means <hi>Tithes from,</hi> or <hi>out of our Estates,</hi> and he blames those who (contrary to the example of the first Christians) not only retained their propriety in their Estate, but did not so
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95318:47"/> much as give Tithes out of it, which it seems was then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the most worldly sort of Christians. But <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> himself, and divers other of the devoutest Christians in that Age did really give Houses and Lands then<note n="(w)" place="margin">Vit. <hi>Cypr. Euseb.</hi> lib. X. pag. 289. Concil. <hi>Antioc.</hi> Can. 24, 25.</note>, so that whatever Doubts Mr. <hi>S.</hi> raises (to maintain his false Assertions) it is plain that the Church then had Lands and Tithes also, in such manner as it was capable to receive them, considering the Persecutions. Nor is it any solid Proof there were no Tithes paid <hi>An.</hi> 380, because <hi>Gratian, Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> then made Laws for paying the Tenth of Mines and Quarries to the Exchequer (as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> objects)<note n="(x)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. 4. p. 39.</note>, for he grants Tithes were paid in <hi>Italy</hi> in the time of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who was contemporary with these Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours<note n="(y)" place="margin">Ibid. Ch. 5. p. 46.</note>; yea the making a Law for paying this sort of extraordinary Tithes to the Exchequer implies, that the ordinary Tithes of Fruits were then given to the Church: for it is most certain the Church was so rich then as that it was envied at by some, as appears from what Mr. <hi>S.</hi> reports both concerning <hi>Damasus</hi> and S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> who both lived in the end of this 400 years<note n="(z)" place="margin">Hist. Ch. 4. p. 40.</note>. And though the things given to the Church were called <hi>Offerings,</hi> yet Mr. <hi>S.</hi> tells us, <hi>the phrase then was to offer Tithes</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Ibid. Ch. 5. p. 46.</note>; so that it is very likely those oblations were usually in the Proportion of a Tenth at least, and therefore the Church then had Tithes. And when <hi>Constantine</hi> made a Law, <hi>That the Clergy of every City should out of the Tributes thereof have yearly measures of Corn given them, in a proportion suitable rather to his bounty than their need</hi>

We need not question but the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour paid a Tithe at least, of that, out of which the People had made oblations before; and <hi>Eusebius</hi> tells us, that he set his Subjects a good Example, for <hi>he gave plentiful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions out of his Estate to the Churches of God — and with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dedicated things he chearfully filled the venerable Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>

Doubtless those pious and bountiful Emperours would have made express Civil Laws for payment of Tenths, if there had been any need; but there was no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion since the Christians did all this time give Tenths, and more freely in obedience to the Law of God, which the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95318:47"/> Fathers taught them required a Tenth part of their Profits at least to be given to the Ministry, as we shall now make out.</p>
               <p n="3">§. III. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Opinion of this 400 is very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly related by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> who mentions none but <hi>Origen</hi> alone in all this Period, and strives to weaken his Testimony also; but we shall both vindicate him and fill up all Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his omissions, and thereby clearly shew the opinion of this Age in point of Tithes. <hi>Irenaeus (who</hi> (as S. <hi>Basil</hi> saith)<note n="(d)" place="margin">

                  <note n="(e)" place="margin">Advers. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. l. 4. c. 34.</note>; and that in the Proportion of a Tenth at least, for he soon after adds, — <hi>the Jews for this cause had their Tenths consecrated, but Christians have dedicated all they have to Gods Service chearfully and freely, not giving that which is less than the Jews, because they have a better hope.</hi> So that it seems he believed none ought to give less than a Tenth to God, and that those who would go to the highest point of duty, ought to dedicate all they had. Yea, he reckons Tithes to be a part of that Moral Law, which Christ came not to abrogate, but enlarge; for where he is speaking of Christs heightning and inlarging things natural and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, his Examples are, that instead of <hi>Thou shalt not commit adultery,</hi> Christ says, <hi>Thou shalt not lust after any:</hi> instead of <hi>Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not be angry, instead of Thou shalt pay Tithes, sell all and give to the Poor, which are not dissolving of the Law, but enlarging it</hi>
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">Id. ibid. cap. 27.</note>. Wherefore he reckons Tithes a Moral Precept, not abrogated by Christ, but enlarged into a Command of giving more, which will still include a Tenth part. Secondly, <hi>Origen</hi> is next,<note place="margin">Origen, An. <hi>200.</hi>
                  </note> who hath other Testimonies besides that which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> quotes, for he saith, though the Christians did not with <hi>Celsus</hi> and the Heathens offer their First-fruits to <hi>Daemons,</hi> yet they did offer them to him who said, Let the Earth bring forth—<hi>to him we offer our First-fruits to whom we send up our Prayers</hi>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95318:48"/> of Christians offering <hi>First-fruits</hi> in the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Tenth also; especially if we observe his discourse about that proportion elsewhere, <hi>The number Ten</hi> (saith he) <hi>is venerable also in the New Testament — and because one Christ is the Author, Fountain, and Original of all, therefore the People offer Tithes to the Ministers and Priests</hi>

                     </note> [And as this is just and decent, so on the contrary, I think it, indecent, unworthy, and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that he who worships God, and enters his House, who knows the Ministers and Priests wait at the Altar, and serve to the preaching of the Word and the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Church, should not offer to the Priests the first of those Fruits which God hath given by him making the Sun to shine and the Rain to fall: Such a Soul seems to me to have no remembrance of God, nor to think or believe he gave these Fruits, since he hoards them up as if God had nothing to do with them; for if he believed them Gods gifts, he would know he ought to honour God with his gifts and blessings, in rewarding the Priests.] And that we may be further taught by Gods own words, these things are to be observed according to the letter, let us further note, the Lord saith in the Gospel, <hi>Woe to you Scribes, Pharisees, Hypocrites, who give Tithes of Mint, Annise, and Cummin, but omit the greater things of the Law; Ye Hypocrites, these things ye ought to have done, and not to have left the other undone.</hi> Mind well how the Word of the Lord would by all means have the greater things of the Law done, but so as these things which are intended to stand according to the letter, be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95318:48"/> not omitted. But if you say, This is said to the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> not to his Disciples, hear him again saying to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Except your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> what therefore he would have done by the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> much more abundantly would he have that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by his Disciples; [but what he would not have to be done by his Disciples, he would not bid the <hi>Pharisees</hi> do;] How therefore doth my righteousness exceed the righteousness of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> if they dare not tast of the Fruits of the Earth, before First-fruits are offered to the Priests, and <hi>Tithes</hi> set apart for the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites;</hi> and I doing neither of these, do so use the Fruits of the Earth that the Priest knows not of them, the <hi>Levite</hi> is not acquainted with them, and the Altar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives no part from them.</q> On these grounds he thus concludes, —<q>This we say, to prove that the Law of First-fruits of Fruits and Cattel, ought to stand according to the letter<note n="(k)" place="margin">

And because Mr. <hi>S.</hi> objects against this, as some do also against other Testimonies of this Age, because they mention <hi>First-fruits</hi> rather than <hi>Tithes,</hi> I will here once for all answer that Exception: First, by observing that Tithes and First-fruits are much of the same kind, both enjoyned by <hi>Moses</hi> Law, and given to maintain that Priesthood, both paid then with divers Ceremonies annexed, and therefore if The Fathers grant <hi>First-fruits</hi> must stand, what reason can be given why not <hi>Tithes</hi> also? 'Tis plain <hi>Origen</hi> thought the connexion so necessary, that he brings a Text for Tithes to prove First-fruits in force, and he here uses the words promiscuously, as believing the establishing of the one confirmed the other also.

Having seen the Opinion of single Fathers for this Period, we need not doubt but (if occasion had been) the Synods (which are the same men met in one body) would have made Canons for payment of these Dues; but since Christians paid them liberally and voluntarily, the Canons of this Age concerning this matter do rather direct the Distribution, than enjoyn the payment.

                  <note place="margin">S. <hi>Hierom, An.</hi> 400.</note> who having sold his own Estate and given it to the Poor, was zealous to have other Clergy men do the like; and if they objected fear of wanting, he intimates they had still such a provision as the <hi>Levites</hi> had, and for his part he did live contentedly on that provision; <hi>If I</hi> (saith he) <hi>be the Lords portion, and a part of his Inheritance, and have no part among the other Tribes; but as a Priest and Levite,</hi> I live of Tithes, <hi>and serving the Altar am sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Altar: having food and rayment with these I will be content, and naked follow the naked Cross</hi>

                     <hi>Hieron.</hi> ad <hi>Nepotian,</hi> Ep. 2. Tom. 1. p. 13.</note>. He intimates plainly that he lived of Tithes and Oblations, as the Priests and <hi>Levites</hi> did, and if this were not so plentiful a Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance as he might have had by keeping his own Estate, he valued not that; but was well content, if with bare ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries (stript of all Propriety) he might follow his Lord and Master, who had no Inheritance, and was crucified naked; and he goes on to advise <hi>Nepotian</hi> not to design to grow rich by becoming a Clergy-man, which intimates the Clergy then had a liberal and certain Income, or else such a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95318:55"/> design had been ridiculous. So that there is no just ground for Mr. <hi>S.</hi> to doubt whether S. <hi>Hierom</hi> pointed at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Tithes here, for he is forced to put a word into the Text, and turn <hi>Sed quasi Levita, vivo de decimis; But live like a Levite, that lived of Tithes,</hi> to make some colour for his needless scruple. And since he grants, Tithes were then paid to the Clergy; and the plain sense of this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is, that S. <hi>Hierom</hi> lived of Tithes, as a <hi>Levite</hi> or Priest (names he often gives to the Christian Clergy<note n="(p)" place="margin">Ad <hi>Evagr.</hi> Ep. 85. Tom. 1. p. 512. In Malach. 3. Tom. 5. p. 641.</note>); what gross partiality is it, to strive to render it improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that a Priest then should live of Tithes. But this place will be made clearer by adding another Testimony declaring the Opinion of the same Father, that Tithes were due under the Gospel; <hi>That which we have said of</hi> Tithes <hi>and</hi> First-fruits, <hi>given by the People of old to the Priests and Levites, do you understand also of Christian People, to whom it is commanded</hi> not only to give Tithes and First-fruits, <hi>but to sell all and give to the Poor, and follow their Lord and Saviour; which if we will not do, at least let us imitate the beginnings of the</hi> Jews, <hi>giving the Poor a part out of the whole, and paying due honour to the Priests and Levites;</hi> (here Mr. <hi>S.</hi> stops, but S. <hi>Hierom</hi> adds) <hi>and he that doth not this manifestly cheats and deceives God</hi>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95318:55"/> It seems <hi>Non solum decimas dare,</hi> in S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> signifies <hi>Non omnino decimas dare,</hi> in Mr. <hi>S.</hi> otherwise, when the Father saith, we are commanded to give Tenths at least, and that we rob God if we give less than that, he would never have said, we were not bound at all to pay this or that part. And for that of selling all, S. <hi>Hierom</hi> plainly makes that a Counsel left to our choice, but paying Tithes a positive command; yea <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (though in this Question our Adversary) free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owns this difference, saying, <hi>Though S.</hi> Hierom <hi>affirms it is commanded to sell all and give to the Poor, he doth not mean it is commanded absolutely, as it is to</hi> Give Tithes, <hi>only if any will be perfect; for of selling all he saith,</hi> If we will not do it—<hi>&amp;c. but of Tithes,</hi> He that doth not this robs God<note n="(s)" place="margin">

Plainly therefore he counts paying Tithes a necessary duty, and that proportion he thinks is the least any man can give, without manifest sinning. Of this quantity therefore were those First-fruits which S. <hi>Hierom</hi> mentions elsewhere; <hi>The First-fruits of all our provisions</hi> (saith he) <hi>are offered to the Priest, so that we taste nothing of new Fruit till the Priest hath first tasted thereof, which we do that he may lay up our Gifts and Oblations in his House, and pray to God to bless our houses</hi>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95318:59"/> that in these Countries Religion was yet scarce setled, and therefore there was yet no setled Ministry to give them to, and in that case better were it they should be paid to the Poor then retained; yet from the custom of all other Churches we may conclude, the Clergy received these Tithes from the People (as soon as they were setled) and dispensed the remainder above their own maintenance, to the Poor.

But we need not multiply Proofs in a case so plain, as this is now evidenced to be, wherefore we conclude, That it was the Opinion of all the Fathers of this 400 years, that Tithes were due to the Clergy by Gods Law, and that the Peoples practice generally was to pay them.</p>
               <p n="2">§. II. Since <hi>Tithes</hi> in general were thus fully believed to belong to the Church, it is not much to the Question what Portions of them were assigned by Kings and Bishops to this or that Church or Monastery, because that only concerns the disposition of what was owned the Churches right before, for which cause I cannot allow the Instances here given by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> being most of them in <hi>France</hi> (where Tithes were certainly paid long before any of these Assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations) to be any more than a meer distribution of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95318:60"/> portions due to the Church in general, and paid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perhaps by some other part of the Clergy, but now fixed on some other Church or Monastery with the Bishops consent. And first for the Antiquity of such Assignations Mr. <hi>S.</hi> rightly observes, that those words in the Council of <hi>Arles</hi>

                     <hi>Bonif.

Whereas these first Instances
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95318:60"/> being all of them Assignations made by Bishops, or with their consent, do sufficiently shew, these either were not new Tithes, or however not Lay or arbitrary Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. At this time also Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> gave his Priviledge to the Monastery of <hi>Monte-Cassino,</hi> that no Bishop should take Tithes thereof, <hi>An.</hi> 748. intimating, they use to take Tithes of others then.

So that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> need not wonder he can find no Precedent or Form in <hi>Marculphus, An.</hi> 660. of any Lay-man's Grant, or arbitrary Consecration of Tithes, though that Author hath collected all other Forms of Conveyances used in his time; for indeed there were no such Grants in <hi>Marcul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> his time, Tithes being then distributed and disposed of only by the Bishops, and if any Lay-man did desire to give any New Tithes to a Monastery or Church, he applied himself to the Bishop to consent to his desire, and to make the Conveyance; which Grants of the Bishops were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward confirmed by the Pope and the King. And this may suffice to shew the way of assigning portions of Tithes to particular Churches in this 400 years.</p>
               <p n="3">§. III. If we consider the Opinion of all the Fathers of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church related before, <hi>Irenaeus, Hilary, Prosper, Germanus</hi> &amp; <hi>Lupus, Sidonius, Caesarius</hi> and <hi>Eligius,</hi> with the practice related by them, we cannot well doubt but Tithes were among the possessions of the Church, in <hi>France,</hi> before <hi>Charles Martel</hi>'s days. Wherefore it being agreed by all, that divers Possessions of the Church were taken away by this Prince and given to his Souldiers, it cannot be at all unlikely, that among other Possessions of the Church he took away Tithes. And it would be very strange that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> both in this Chapter and the Review, should labour
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95318:61"/> so earnestly to disprove it, and to make it seem a common Tale, but only that it agrees not to his espoused Opinion; and he saith, <hi>If it were true, it were Authority of great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and fair proof both for general payment and special en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment in those Times</hi>

We have also shewed in the last Section that <hi>Bishopricks</hi> and <hi>Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> were endowed with Tithes before his time, so that since <hi>Boniface</hi> Bishop of <hi>Mentz</hi> (his Contemporary)<note n="(b)" place="margin">

We conclude therefore, that <hi>Martel</hi> did take Tithes from the Church as well as other possessions, and that it is evident
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95318:62"/> Churches were endowed with perpetual right of Tithes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Sacriledge, <hi>An.</hi> 740, or rather 731.</p>

Wherefore we Appoint and Decree, That the ancient Custom be revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among the Faithful; And that all the People bring in the Tithes, which serve to (maintain) Ecclesiastical Worship, which the Priests laying out for the use of the Poor and redemption of Captives, by their Prayers may obtain peace and safety to the People; and if any be contumacious to this our wholsom Order, he shall be for ever excommunicated<note n="(b)" place="margin">

This Testimony is so clear, that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> uses all his art to disparage it; and though he saith, <hi>No doubt can be made, but that in most Churches in this time, amongst the Offerings of those of the devouter sort, Tenths, or greater parts of their annual Increase, were given according to the doctrine of the Fathers</hi>
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. 5. p. 65.</note>; yet he hath no mind to allow a Canon in that Age for Tithes: But his Arguments, or rather Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures against it, are so weak, that they express his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires rather than his power to disprove it, I am sure he reckons it among <hi>the known and certain Monuments of Truth</hi>

But Secondly, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> would insinuate that <hi>Agobardus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lyons</hi> (in which Province <hi>Mascon</hi> was) about the year 828 knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this Canon, because he saith, that nothing had then been ordained in Synods about endowing Churches, because the Devotion of former Ages made it needless; but how unjustly he makes this Inference will appear from <hi>Agobardus</hi> his words at large: He is there pleading the right of Tithes, and answering their Objection who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, there were no Canons of great Synods (that is, General Councils) for them at that time, and thus speaks; <q>A man may know what Councils have defined in this matter, if he will read and turn them over, but some will not receive the <hi>French</hi> Canons, nor those of other Provinces, because the Popes and Emperors Legates were not present at the making of them — but we should think reverently even of Provincial Councils, and where there are no Canons of greater Synods, we ought to consult the Statutes of the Ancients, and to prefer their Opinion before our own, because even Provincial Canons were made agreeable to Scripture, and to former usages. And now if nothing were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in Synods, or publickly preached by the Fathers about endowing Churches, it was because there was no necessity, Religious devotion being then every where so fervent<note n="(i)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Agobardus</hi> de disp. rei Eccles. contr. Sacril. p. 276.</note>.</q> Can any thing be plainer, then that <hi>Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardus</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:95318:64"/> expresly declares there were Provincial Canons for Tithes made in <hi>France,</hi> and other Countries before his time, which ought to satisfie any man, though there were no Canons of General Synods, because these Provincial Canons were grounded on Scripture and ancient Usage, and because there would have been Canons of General Councils, but only that there was no need of them. Which is so far from lessening the Authority of the Canon of <hi>Mascon,</hi> that it hugely strengthens it; and we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, either Mr. <hi>S.</hi> never saw this place in <hi>Agobardus,</hi> or if he did he resolved to make the most unjust pretence serve to disparage this Testimony. To which end also he notes, <hi>That the Laws which this Council calls</hi> Divinas Leges, <hi>must be the Mosaical Law</hi>
                  <note n="(k)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. 5. p, 48.</note>; whereas whoever will read the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, cannot but see they mean the Laws of Christ, for how can they say, <hi>Moses</hi> Laws took care of the Ministers of the Christian Church, or how should any Christians be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for observing <hi>Moses</hi> Law, or Excommunicated for breaking it? Again the words, <hi>Long time observed by the whole company of Christians;</hi> Mr. <hi>S.</hi> pretends, look back no higher than the time of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> which yet is a fair proof of general payment ever since before the beginning of this 400 years; but considering these were both foreign Bishops, and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> was Bishop of this very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince <hi>An.</hi> 180. and had preached, Christians were bound to offer not less than a Tenth, it is most likely the Council of <hi>Mascon</hi> refers to the Age of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> ever since which time it is very probable these of the Province of <hi>Lyons</hi> had paid Tithes.</p>
               <p>Another Decree Mr. <hi>S.</hi> mentions<note n="(l)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. 5. p. 58.</note> of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Fourth, which saith, <hi>It seemeth good not only to us, but to our Predecessors, that Tithes shall be paid by the People in right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and only to the Mother Church</hi>
                  <note n="(m)" place="margin">Decret. par. 3. c. 115.</note>; and if <hi>Ivo</hi> have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed this to a Decree of Pope <hi>Gelasius,</hi> who lived <hi>An.</hi> 492. it is no such great mistake, for <hi>Leo</hi> the IVth indeed was not Pope till after the year 840; but in regard he refers back to the Decrees of his Predecessors, therefore we must reckon this thing had been decreed long before the end of this 400 years.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:95318:64"/>
               <p>But shortly after that of <hi>Mascon,</hi> was that Council at <hi>Hispalis, An.</hi> 590, (and not 610, as it is false printed in Mr. <hi>S. p.</hi> 61.) where it was decreed, <q>That Rich and Poor do rightly offer all the First-fruits and Tithes, as well of Cattel as of Fruits unto their Churches, for the Lord saith by the Prophet, <hi>Bring ye all the Tithes into the Store-house, &amp;c.

And first he tells us, <hi>The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil is extant whole, and yet no such Canon in it;</hi> whereas <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi> in <hi>Binius,</hi> out of whom Mr. <hi>S.</hi> cites this Council here, expresly saith, <hi>I think this Council is not extant whole — and that many other things were decreed in this Council which are not extant</hi>

Wherefore, since <hi>Garsias</hi> his MSS. had not the whole Council, we must consult the old Collectors of single Canons for the rest, and <hi>Ivo</hi> hath this Canon out of this very Council, and so hath <hi>Burchard</hi> also; and since Mr. <hi>S.</hi> quarrelled with the Canon of <hi>Mascon,</hi> because it was not in these Compilers, surely he will allow this which we find there. But Secondly, he saith, <hi>This Canon is clearly of later times, the first words of it being nothing else but the syllables of one of</hi> Charlemain<hi>'s Laws, An.</hi> 780. To which I reply, That Mr. <hi>S.</hi> very well knew that those Laws of <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemain</hi> were no more, but a Collection taken out of former Canonical Institutions, as the Emperor himself declares<note n="(p)" place="margin">Praefat. ad <hi>Capitul.</hi> l. 1.</note>; and sometimes the Old Council, out of which these Laws were taken is named<note n="(q)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Capit.</hi> l. 1. cap. 1, 7, 14, 19, &amp;c.</note>; sometimes the Council is not named, and yet the very words of some Old Council are set down<note n="(r)" place="margin">

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95318:65"/> a Law in his Dominions, and therefore no doubt these words were transcribed by <hi>Charlemain</hi> into his <hi>Capitulars</hi> out of the old Council of <hi>Hispalis,</hi> without naming the place whence he took it; and it is certain he transcribes the very words of another Canon, which <hi>Ivo, Burchard,</hi> and <hi>Gratian,</hi> do ascribe to this very Council of <hi>Hispalis,</hi> and which is not to be found elsewhere than in those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers<note n="(s)" place="margin">Concil. <hi>Hispal.</hi> ap. <hi>Bin.</hi> Tom. 2. par. 2. pag. 294. Collat. cum <hi>Capit.</hi> lib. 5. cap. 175.</note>. So that the words of this Canon being found in the <hi>Capitulars,</hi> is so far from weakning the Authority of it, that it shews there was a Copy of this Council ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in <hi>Charles</hi> the Greats time, out of which both he and these Compilers took this Canon, and therefore it stands for good Evidence after all Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his endeavours to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it.</p>
               <p>And it doth confirm the former Canon, that a Council in <hi>Spain</hi> also, <hi>An.</hi> 633. doth decree, <hi>According to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of former Councils, the Bishop shall have the third part as well of Oblations, as of</hi> Tithes, <hi>and tribute of Fruits</hi>

               <p>But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> owns that the word is used in the Council of <hi>Friuli, An.</hi> 791. where there is a long Canon to urge the payment of <hi>Tithes</hi> and <hi>First-friuts,</hi> from Gods promises of Plenty, and of his blessing on them that observe it, and his Threatnings against the neglecters thereof<note n="(x)" place="margin">Concil. <hi>Foro Juliens.</hi> Can. 14. <hi>Bin.</hi> Tom. 3. par. 1. §. 2. pag. 139.</note>. He grants this is a good Testimony of the Synods Opinion, but thinks it rather a declaration by doctrine then a Constitution by precept: To which I reply, That when a Synod declare their Opinion in a matter of Practice, they do it to oblige men to obey that declaration; and these Fathers tell us, they chose to give this Rule rather in Gods words than their own, in hopes they would be more effectual.</p>

This last Section (which is the 6th in Mr. <hi>S.</hi>) is wholly spent in Cavils, and little Artifices to lessen the former Testimonies; and what concerns the Council of <hi>Mascon,</hi> is answered in its proper place before, and the rest shall be now examined. First, he objects, <hi>Tithes are not named in any Old Collections of the Canons,</hi> p. 65. besides what is already said to this, I now further reply, that we have the word <hi>Decimae</hi> undoubtedly in those Canons of <hi>Mascon, Hispalis,</hi> and <hi>Friuli,</hi> which are justified for Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic before.

                     <hi>Hinemar. Rhemens.</hi> Ep. 7. c. 35.</note>, the thing it self therefore is plain, whatever words be used in any of the old Compilers or Collectors. And whereas he would make us believe it was only the firmer and devouter Christians then, who gave Tithes; I answer, No such matter appears in any Testimony he hath brought; for that Exhortation written about the year 700 (cited by Mr. <hi>S. p.</hi> 66.) declares he is no good Christian that pays not his Tithes yearly: and the Epistle of <hi>Boniface, An.</hi> 750 im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that it was a usual thing to pay them, and so do all the forementioned Testimonies both for Opinion and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; indeed the Fathers and Councils both, do esteem them extreamly wicked who do not pay them, which shews it was not only the best and firmest Christians who paid them. Thirdly, He pretends they were sometimes given to the Priests, sometimes to Abbots, and sometimes to the Poor, which is no more but that Tithes were given usually to the Secular Clergy, and by special consent of the Bishop to the regular Clergy, and after their maintenance was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the Poor had the rest, as is largely proved before. Fourthly, He suggests the Quantity was Arbitrary; but if so, then the Opinions of Fathers, and the Canons of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils signified nothing, yea the Law of God, as then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and the Practice of above 500 years continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance must be supposed of no force: I am sure no other Proportion is named, and this is strictly required; and if Mr. <hi>S.</hi> could have produced any Instances of variety in the proportion, he might have had some pretence for this false Assertion, but he produces not one instance of such a kind; wherefore all that was arbitrary then, was to give more than a Tenth, as many did by voluntary oblations besides; but who can imagine that this Age thought the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion arbitrary, when the Tenth was generally held to be due by Gods Law, and where that sufficed not, it was
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95318:66"/> strictly enjoyned under the penalty of Excommunication, as we see in the Canon of <hi>Mascon</hi> cited above. Wherefore it is strange confidence in Mr. <hi>S.</hi> to affirm here, <hi>That he only was compellable by Excommunication who offered not at all, not he who offered in a less quantity:</hi> And for the place he cites out of <hi>Photius</hi> his <hi>Nomo-Canon,</hi> it is nothing to the case of Tithes, for <hi>Photius</hi> speaks of other voluntary Oblations, not of the fixed maintenance of the Clergy, <hi>It was</hi> (he saith) <hi>forbid to Clergy-men under the penalty of</hi> 10 l. <hi>or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation to excommunicate any for not making these offerings</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">

And Mr. <hi>S.</hi> will not allow Tithes were paid at all in the Eastern Church, so that he most unjustly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently cites this Eastern Law, to prove Men were not compellable by Excommunication to pay Tithes in the Western Church. And it is as little to the purpose which he is speaking of, to tell us that <hi>Tithes</hi> were a matter of special bounty in the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Churches, and yet the Prayer he produces out of their old Liturgy confutes that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence too; for public Prayers are rarely put into the forms of any Church unless for Cases ordinarily happening, and the Prayer it self calls <hi>Tithes</hi> and <hi>First-fruits, Munera Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae,</hi> the Rewards of the Church, which implies a due, and if they gave them in sign of their gratitude to God, so do those also who pay Tithes ordinarily, as it is very likely these Christians did, from the clear practice of their neighbouring Churches in <hi>Egypt,</hi> cited out of <hi>Isidore Peleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siota,</hi> and <hi>Cassian,</hi> in the beginning of this Chapter, and I dare appeal to any, if this Prayer of the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Liturgy do not well agree with usual payment of <hi>Tithes</hi> and <hi>First-fruits</hi> as the Rewards due to God and the Church. Fifthly, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> designs to make way for his <hi>arbitrary Lay foundations,</hi> by saying, that <hi>by the practice of some places the Lay Patron might assign a part of these offerings to the Minister, and enjoy the rest at his pleasure</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. 5. p. 67.</note>, which he would prove out of the Councils of <hi>Bracara</hi> and <hi>Toledo;</hi> but for the first of these, the Council of <hi>Bracara,</hi> the Canon indeed mentions a wicked practice of some places for Covetous Lay-men to build Churches on their Land for gain, that they may
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95318:67"/> share with the Priests in the Peoples oblations, but it charges no such thing be done any more, and forbids the Bishop (without whose consent no Church could have any right to take Offerings) ever to consecrate any such Church, or consent <hi>to so abominable a design</hi>
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Concil. <hi>Bracar.</hi> 2. Can. 6. An. 572. <hi>Bin.</hi> Tom. 2. par. 2. p. 235.</note>. And will Mr. <hi>S.</hi> plead the abominable and condemned practices of notorious wicked Men shews any right of Lay-Patrons? That such things were done indeed is true, but that they might be done appears no otherwise than by the Canons condemning them; by which way of arguing Mr. <hi>S.</hi> may prove, that we might kill, fornicate, consult with Wizards, commit Rapes, or do any other ill things, for all these also are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid by Canons; and yet this fallacy of arguing Right, from those very Testimonies which condemn any evil pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is every where obvious in Mr. <hi>S.</hi> But as for this Canon of <hi>Bracara,</hi> it makes very little to his purpose if such a Custom could be proved thence, because it implies the Lay-founder had no right to any Oblations, but it was the Bishops consecration alone which annexed the right of them to the Church, and if he refused to consecrate it, there could no Oblations belong to it. And his next Quotation out of the Ninth Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> manifestly shews the Founder had no right at all to the Church Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, for it Appoints, <hi>That the Founder or his heirs shall complain to the Bishop, or the King, if the Church Revenues be ill managed by the Incumbent;</hi> but withal saith, <hi>That these Heirs must not pretend these things are their own, or that they can exercise any power over them in their own right</hi>

An. 655. <hi>Bin.</hi> Tom. 2. p. 2. pag. 514.</note>, which evidently proves the contrary to that for which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> brings it, and plainly shews that <hi>Lay Patrons might not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of Church Revenues.</hi> And though Mr. <hi>S.</hi> (which too often needlesly fills his Margen) be pleased but to quote one Canon of this time, which puts Church Revenues into the Bishops power<note n="(e)" place="margin">Concil. <hi>Aurel.</hi> 1. c. 13. ap. <hi>Seld.</hi> p. 67.</note>, he might have produced very many more to the same purpose, since all Canons agree in this point<note n="(f)" place="margin">Concil. <hi>Araus.</hi> c. 10. An. 441. Concil. <hi>Ilerd.</hi> c. 3. An. 525. <hi>Aurel.</hi> 4. cap. 7. An. 547. <hi>Tolet.</hi> 3. c. 19. An. 589. <hi>Tol.</hi> 4. c. 32, 34.

So that if any Lay Patron did sacrilegiously
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95318:67"/> seize on the Revenues of any Church, it was not by any right he had thereto, but contrary to Law, Reason, and Religion also. Lastly Mr. <hi>S.</hi> here saith, he had never seen any Law mentioning <hi>Tithes</hi> in the Eastern Church, and <hi>pag.</hi> 245. he affirms there was no certain proportion there determined, but they were chiefly maintained by the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. To which I reply, that from the Testimony of <hi>Origen, Epiphanius,</hi> S. <hi>Chrysostom, Isidore,</hi> and others, it is plain that anciently the <hi>Tenth</hi> was determined even in the Eastern Church, to be the least proportion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Oblations; and if this were the effect of leaving the quantity undetermined by Law (as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> intimates) that their Priests had no certain maintenance, then we may see the inconvenience of leaving the Ministers main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to arbitrary Devotion, and may perceive that the Western Emperors and Bishops shewed more piety and prudence too, in making both Secular and Ecclesiastical Laws for the payment of a Tenth. And yet it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that there was an use of paying Tithes also in the Eastern Church, for Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third affirms Tithes were paid in his time at <hi>Constantinople</hi>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95318:68"/> to Mens Estates; and if for want of an exact knowledge of Lay-mens Estates that Church took what Men gave in <hi>Balsomon</hi>'s time, yet it is very likely that the due was the old proportion of a Tenth at least: and Mr. <hi>S.</hi> in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript Answer to Doctor <hi>Tildesly</hi> saith, <hi>I said no Laws there do mention Tithes—but for payment there I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly affirmed it.</hi> We therefore conclude, that there was payment of Tithes in the East, and both payment and Laws for it Civil and Ecclesiastical in the Western Church, before the end of this Period.</p>

Surely the Parochial-right was well setled then, when the Clergy were so punished for doing any thing against it, and the Laity so strictly forbidden all that might tend to it.

All which abundantly shews, that it could not be done very often, and whensoever it was, it was condemned and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished both by the Church and State, and therefore surely the Acts of wicked and Lawless men cannot prove that the Laity had any right to make Arbitrary Consecrations, any more than the like facts of such persons can prove Simony, Bribery, or Perjury to be right, because some have done these acts.</p>
               <p>But we hasten to his Examples, by which he is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident he shall prove these <hi>Arbitrary Consecrations,</hi> though I doubt not to shew in every one of the particulars, that they do all either virtually or expresly contain the Bishops consent, and are not arbitrary consecrations of the Laity;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95318:70"/> But Assignations of some portions of Tithes by the Bishops consent to some particular Church or Monastery, and if this could not be done without the Bishops leave, then it was no Arbitrary Consecration.</p>
               <p>It is somewhat strange that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his first instance of Arbitrary Consecrations should be of the <hi>French</hi> Princes, who made such strict Laws against them, and if the elder <hi>Pipin, Charles Martel,</hi> and <hi>Caroloman,</hi> Ancestors of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, did assign the Tithe of their Customs about <hi>Ʋ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trecht</hi> to that Cathedral, this is no good proof of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary consecration of Parochial Tithes; for first the Tithes of Customs, as also of Wreck, Treasure-trove, and Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, were not ordinary Tithes belonging to any Parish Church. Secondly, It is no more but an assignation to a Cathedral Church of such Tithes within the Diocess as were not before ('tis likely) claimed by any Parochial Church. Thirdly, This Charter was made as the very words of it declare, <q>because <hi>Boniface</hi> the Archbishop de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired it, who as Guardian and Bishop then presided over the Church of <hi>Ʋtrecht</hi>
                     <note n="(m)" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Chart.</hi> apud Miraeum de Canon. cap. 20.</note>.</q> Which Sentence Mr. <hi>S.</hi> conceals, as shewing the Bishops consent, and sufficiently manifesting this was no Lay arbitrary consecration.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Gutha</hi>'s Promise to the Bishop of <hi>Ʋtrecht,</hi> to endow a new built Church (which he gave to the Church of <hi>Ʋtrecht</hi>) with the Tithes of four Villages<note n="(n)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. 6. p. 74.</note>, shews, that the Bishop was to be made acquainted how the Laity disposed of the Tithes in their Diocesses; and if <hi>Gutha</hi> could have done this arbitrarily, why did he apply himself to the Bishop? Indeed the custom of <hi>Germany</hi> was, That all the Tithes in the Diocess should be given to the Bishop, who distributed so much of them to the Country Clergy as he thought fit; and if this Custom (as is very likely) then obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Ʋtrecht,</hi> this may easily be discerned to be no more, but that usual endowing of new Churches with Tithes, which the Builders were obliged to consent to, before the Bishop might be allowed to consecrate the Church; but it was the Bishops Act at consecration that gave that particular Church a right to those Tithes, not the Lay Mans Promise.</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:95318:71"/>
               <p>Thirdly, If <hi>Raginer</hi> and <hi>Rigimer,</hi> two Dukes of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> did endow two Monasteries with <hi>Decimas quas habebant, the Tithes that they had in two several Towns,</hi> that phrase, <hi>Which they had,</hi> implies this was rather a restitution of some infeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date Tithes taken from the Church by <hi>Charles Martel,</hi> and given to these Princes, than any original Grant; and it is no wonder if the Bishops were ready to consent to Lay-mens giving back such Tithes either to Churches or to Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, rather than keep them in their own Hands, however the Law at that time, and the Custom also, was, That these endowments of Monasteries should be made by the Bishop of the Diocess where the Tithes lay, in whom it was believed the right of all Tithes was originally vested, and by whose Act Tithes were then only judged to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally conveyed, as the next Example would have fully shewed, if Mr. <hi>S.</hi> had fairly related it. For,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Tithes given to the Monks of <hi>Clugny</hi> were only Tithes of their own demesn Lands, which were then called <hi>Decimas indominicatas</hi>

But nothing is plainer than that Bishops did in this Age actually grant those Tithes which Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries had, by Charters, having the very words of <hi>Damus &amp; concedimus,</hi> as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> here confesses concerning <hi>Adhemar</hi> Bishop of <hi>Xantoign;</hi> nor was it done by one Bishop only,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95318:71"/> for an Abbot of <hi>Clugny,</hi> who lived a little after, saith, <hi>They had right to those Churches with all their Revenues, which they justly, freely, and Canonically possessed, being bestowed on them by the Bishops, without any Mony given for them</hi>

               <p>Fifthly, The Abby of <hi>Vendosm,</hi> founded (not as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> mistakes, <hi>An.</hi> 1050, but) <hi>An.</hi> 1033<note n="(s)" place="margin">

This was a Grant made by a Church-man, and confirmed by Pope <hi>Ʋrban, An.</hi> 1088, (that is, 'tis likely almost as soon as these Tithes were first granted) as this same <hi>Geoffry</hi> of <hi>Vendosm</hi> doth affirm in this very Epistle which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> cites<note n="(t)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Geofr. Vind.</hi> l. 3. Ep. 41.</note>. And within a short time after, <hi>viz. An.</hi> 1120, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> confesses that it was generally believed in all <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> that even Churches were obliged to pay Tithes to other Churches, if the one had Lands in the others Parish, so firmly then was the Parochial Right setled<note n="(u)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. 6. p. 76.</note>. Whence we may conclude, that his next instance of <hi>Ansellus de Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landa</hi>'s Grants to his new Abby of <hi>Gornay, An.</hi> 1124, had the Bishops consent and confirmation, or otherwise they had not been valid either by the Law of the Time, or the Custom of <hi>Normandy,</hi> where the Bishops always gave leave to the founding and endowing of Abbies, of which there is an Example <hi>An.</hi> 1080<note n="(w)" place="margin">Epist. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selm.</hi> l. 2. ep. 14. in not. ibid. pag. 53.</note>; and many other proofs in the second Tome of the <hi>Monasticon.</hi> Whence we may conclude, That the Confirmation of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, of all the Tithes given to the Abby of <hi>Holy Cross,</hi> and S. <hi>Leoffrid</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> was grounded upon former Charters of Bishops, this Bull of the Pope bearing date 100 year after the first Foundation, and it mentions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly the Grant of the Bishop of <hi>Eureux,</hi> in whose Diocess this Abby was; and since the Canonical Rights of that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop are reserved in these Tithes, as the Bull mentions, we
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95318:72"/> may be sure these Tithes were granted at first by the Bishops consent: Nor can we imagine this Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> would confirm so many arbitrary Lay Grants of Tithes, who saith, <hi>No Lay-men can grant Tithes to others, because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rightly possess Tithes themselves</hi>
                  <note n="(x)" place="margin">Decretal. Lib. 3. Tit. 30. c. 31. p. 1347.</note>. And indeed all the Popes Bulls do confirm only those Tithes <hi>which the Abbies did justly and Canonically possess.</hi> Now according to the Canons no Abby justly possessed Tithes but by the Bishops Grant; so that hitherto we have not one full or fair proof of any arbitrary Lay Consecration.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, But finally Mr. <hi>S.</hi> crouds into his Margen a heap of Examples of Arbitrary Consecrations, as he pretends, whereas every one of them, being searched, do only shew Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his unjust dealing in concealing the Bishops consent, which is mentioned in every one of these Quotations. <hi>First,</hi> That of <hi>Galfridus, Vicecomes,</hi> expresly speaks of the consent of <hi>Theodoric,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chartres</hi>

                  <note n="(z)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 174.</note>. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That of <hi>Adelardus</hi> hath these words, <hi>Ego Rainal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Andegavorum Episcopus donum quod</hi> Adelardus —<hi>per ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num nostram Sancto</hi> Albino <hi>de decimâ portus castelli sui fecit — confirmavi</hi>

                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Miraeus</hi> de Canonicis, cap. 91.</note>. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The last Decree of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> was only a confirmation of what the Archbishop of the Province had by his Charter granted before, <hi>Sicut</hi> (saith he) <hi>in ejusdem Archiepiscopi Authentico plenius continetur, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmamus</hi>
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Innocent.</hi> 3. decret. Ep. l. 1. pag. 160.</note>. So that every one of these directly destroy his false Opinion of <hi>Lay Arbitrary Consecrations,</hi> nor can we imagine Mr. <hi>S.</hi> would gave produced them here, but that he hoped his Reader would take them on his word, without ever searching the places.</p>
               <p>He proceeds to hook in all passages that might give any colour to these pretended Arbitrary Consecrations, of which he explains that Arbitrary disposition of Tithes to the Poor, about the year 1200<note n="(d)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. 6. p. 78.</note>, condemned (he saith)
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95318:72"/> by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third. But if it were poor Monks to whom these Tithes were given, why should this Pope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the practice, since he produces the same Pope in the very last Page, <hi>viz.</hi> 77, as confirming such Grants to the Monasteries; wherefore though it be true that <hi>Pauperes</hi> be sometimes put for <hi>Monks,</hi> yet here it signifies <hi>the ordinary Poor,</hi> who are plainly meant as well in the Sermon he cites, as in the Epistles<note n="(e)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Innoc.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. Ep. l. 2. pag. 483.</note>, and Decretals of the same Pope<note n="(f)" place="margin">Decretal. l. 3. Tit. 30. c. 26. p. 1340.</note>. And in all these places the practice is condemned, though it be there intimated to be occasioned by the uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Clergy, which moved some Lay-men to give part of their Tithes immediately to the Poor, whom the Clergy so much neglected, and therein did an act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice under pretence of Charity, as those Decretals de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare: So that this doth not shew any right of disposition of Tithes in Lay-men originally, but an illegal act of some few, grounded on the Clergies Male-administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Practice of those Bishops, who claimed (not Predial, but) Personal Tithes of a Family after its removal into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diocess<note n="(g)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. 6. p. 79.</note>, shews, that not only continual payment of many years, but the Doctrine of the Fathers, and the Laws of God and Men, had now so setled Tithes, that they must be paid to some Church or other; and this being only a Question which Church had right to these Tithes, and a dispute between two Bishops about the distribution of them, is nothing at all to Lay-mens arbitrary giving them, but rather supposes the Clergy were to determine to what Church men should pay; and the Pope here blames the Bishop from whose Diocess the Family was removed for claiming Personal Tithes<note n="(h)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Innoc.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. Ep. l. 1. pag. 83.</note>: and soon after another Pope expresly determines the matter, <hi>viz. That predial Tithes shall be paid to the Church in whose Parish the Land lies, and personal to that in whose Parish the man dwells</hi>
                  <note n="(i)" place="margin">Decret. l. 3. Tit. 29. cap. 5. pag. 1323.</note>. Yea, and the Decretal Epistle here cited says nothing of any Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Consecration, but expresly saith, <hi>Their Ancestors had paid Tithes to their own Bishop or Priest in former times,</hi> which implies an Ancient right and due.</p>

               <p>Lastly, He would infer <hi>Arbitrary Consecrations</hi> from the Phrase <hi>Redimere decimas,</hi> used in the Capitulars and Canons about the beginning of this Period. As if the Laity, who forced the Clergy to redeem Tithes had acted fairly, and only sold their own right; but I reply, That wherever this Phrase is used, the Laity who did force the Clergy to redeem Tithes, are condemned as wicked and unjust Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for this Act, and he confesses here, that <hi>Hincmarus Rhemensis</hi> affirmed, <hi>That the most profligate Lay-men in his Parish durst not presume to take mony for his Tithes</hi>
                  <note n="(k)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Flodoard.</hi> hist. <hi>Rhem.</hi> l. 3. cap. 25.</note>. Yea, the Emperor, in the <hi>Capitular</hi> cited by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> orders his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer to force such Men to pay their Tithe freely<note n="(l)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Capitul.</hi> l. 5. c. 46.</note>; and can any man infer a right from so exploded a practice? Indeed the very word <hi>Redimere,</hi> shews that Tithes were the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies own before, or else it would rather be said, they <hi>bought them,</hi> than <hi>redeemed them;</hi> for as S. <hi>Anselme</hi> ingeniously notes upon God's redeeming our Souls, that they were his before, <hi>For we are said to buy that which was anothers, but to redeem our own</hi>

                     <hi>Anselm.</hi> in Tit. cap 2.</note>; if therefore some Lay-men were so unjust, as to force the Clergy to redeem that which was their own; this neither proves the Laity had any right to Tithes, nor yet that the Clergy had none. <hi>Ivo</hi> tells us, that some Lay-men forced the Priests to redeem the very Oblations of the Altar<note n="(n)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ivo Curnot.</hi> Epist. 12.</note>; but no man will say they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Laity. But finally, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> confesses, that <hi>Hales,</hi> by <hi>Tithes redeemed,</hi> means only feudal Tithes, which were first taken from the Church; and no doubt the Clergy would retrieve these on any Terms from Lay-possessors, and if this be the sense, it is still less to his arbitrary Lay Consecrations, which now I hope we have fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95318:74"/> was vested both the maintenance, and care of governing all the Country Churches in his Diocess, as was proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of the old Canons<note n="(o)" place="margin">Chap. 5. §. 5</note>; and though every one of these Country Priests had his certain proportion of the Profits, yet it was assigned by the Bishop, who both chose the <hi>Oeconomus</hi> and took in his Accounts<note n="(p)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Isid. Peleus.</hi> l. 2. ep. 127.</note>. He confesses also that the Bishop put in all Incumbents, and distributed the whole Revenue (according to the Canons) for the first 500 years, and we have proved Tithes were paid to the Church long before that time; whence it appears that Lay-men of old had nothing to do with the disposal of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and if they had any such Power afterwards, it must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin either by Usurpation or Grant from the Clergy. But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> is mistaken in saying, that Lay-men began to put in Incumbents almost as soon as they began to build Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and that these Incumbents received the Profits without any Admission from the Bishop<note n="(q)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. 6. p. 83.</note>. For it is certain, Lay-men began to build Churches long before the year 500, yet so long he consesses the Revenues were distributed by the Disposition of the <hi>Hierarchy.</hi> The first Council of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> mentions Lay-mens building Churches, and forbids any but the Bishop of the Diocess to dedicate them<note n="(r)" place="margin">Concil: <hi>Araus.</hi> 1.

So that <hi>if</hi> (as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> speaks, <hi>p.</hi> 81.) <hi>we may conjecture the use of the time, by what Laws and Canons ordain;</hi> even after Lay-men built Churches by the leave of Bishops, they had nothing at all to do with the Revenue, nor did they till after the year 500 so much as present In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents for the Bishops approbation.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>S.</hi> indeed pretends, that <hi>for all these Canons divers Lay Patrons had, or at least challenged an interest in the Profits of the Churches they built</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. 6. p. 84.</note>; which he would prove by those Canons of <hi>Bracara</hi> and <hi>Toledo,</hi> which he produced, and we examined before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. §. 6. yet here (according to his custom of repeating every thing twice or thrice, that seems to make against the Churches right) he brings them on the stage again; but we refer the Reader thither for the confutation of this pretence, where it doth appear that the Canon of <hi>Bracara</hi> supposes such a vile thing had been sometimes done by connivance perhaps of the Bishop, but utterly condemns it, and forbids the Bishops consent to so wicked a practice; and the Canon of <hi>Toledo</hi> evidently declares the Patron and his Heirs had no right to Church Revenues, nor remedy for the abuse of them by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent, but by Complaint first to the Bishop, and then to the King; both which do disprove his Assertion. But he brings a strange proof of Lay-Founders challenging a right in the Profits of the Church, out of an Epistle at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to Pope <hi>Damasus, An.</hi> 380, where he saith, this is titled <hi>An old Custom;</hi> to which I reply the words are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Hanc consuetudinem,</hi> that is, the Decree saith, it was an ill Custom of that time (not for Lay-Founders surely, who Mr. <hi>S.</hi> saith, began not to build Churches till <hi>An.</hi> 500, but) for some of the Laity sacrilegiously to seize (by violence,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:95318:75"/> and not by any pretence of right) upon the Church Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues; which practice is there condemned, but it is nothing to Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his purpose. And yet if it were, since this is only a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree attributed to <hi>Damasus</hi> by <hi>Ivo</hi> and <hi>Gratian</hi> (whose Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions he elsewhere so much undervalues)<note n="(b)" place="margin">

               <p>Another proof of Lay-mens challenging a right to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the Endowments and Offerings of those Churches whereof they were Patrons, is, <hi>That divers times provision is made against it in the Capitulars;</hi> but he wisely cites no particular place, and indeed there is none that provides against their challenging Offerings, and for other Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though some very ill Men against all right did Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegiously seize of them toward the end of this Period; yet it was an Usurpation, and was remedied by those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Canons which condemned and forbid it<note n="(c)" place="margin">Concil. <hi>Valent.</hi> can. 9.

And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Patron could not without great injustice pretend any right to any of these Profits, because before the Bishop consecrated any new erected Church, the Founder did first by a Writing under his hand solemnly settle these Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Profits on the Church, which, with the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Church to the Bishop, were delivered into his hand before the Consecration<note n="(d)" place="margin">Concil: <hi>Bracar.</hi> 2. can. 5.

And since the very right of Patronage was first derived from the Church, it is very unreasonable in Mr. <hi>S.</hi> to suppose, that Patrons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served any such liberty to collate without the Bishop, when as the very power they had to Nominate, was from the favour of the Church to encourage the building of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.

                  </note>; whence it is plain that <hi>Commendatio Ecclesiae</hi> did suppose the Bishops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and was not (as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> falsly expounds it) <hi>The Livery of a Church and the Endowments, to the Incumbent, to take care and dispose of, as a Ʋsufructuary of what the Patron was the Proprietary, or as a Tenant of that whereof he was in rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:</hi> there being no ground from Antiquity or Reason for any such pretended Propriety in the Patron. And indeed it is an odd Propriety which a man hath to a thing, that he can neither take to his own use, nor give to another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the consent of a Third person; and a strange kind of Tenancy, when the Lessor must receive no acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, nor retains any power to put the Lessee out of possession in any case whatsoever. Yet so strangely doth Mr. <hi>S.</hi> dote upon this Opinion that he fancies every thing he meets with sounds that way, or else he would never have attempted to prove the Bishop had nothing to do
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95318:77"/> with the Endowments by a Canon of the Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> which was made within that first 500 years, while, by his own confession, the Endowments were wholly in the disposal of the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> p. 82; and the meaning of ordaining a Man without a Title then, implies only, that (though the Bishops then filled all Country Churches, yet) the Bishops could not put an Incumbent into a Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready full, and therefore if there were no Vacancy, he might not ordain any <hi>Sine Titulo:</hi> But if he did ordain any so, the very Law of Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> here cited by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> declares the Orders were not void, but the Bishop should maintain him that was so Ordained till some Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came void<note n="(t)" place="margin">Decretal. l. 3. tit. 5. c. 16. pag. 1128.</note>; all which proves not, that the Bishop did not collate, but only that he had not alwaies Vacancies ready to bestow, which is nothing to Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his purpose. And whether the Patron chose a Person ordained, or not yet ordained, it is all one, since even <hi>Duarenus</hi> himself (whom Mr. <hi>S.</hi> here cites) saith, <hi>The Patron hath no right at all to administer the goods of the Church, and consequently can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give such power to another meerly by his own Act</hi>

The truth is, that though originally the disposition of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es was wholly in the Bishops, yet they had so far receded from their own right, as to allow the Patron a power of Nomination; so that now neither could the Bishop with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Patron, nor the Patron without the Bishop dispose of a Church with its Endowment, but the Bishop had the advantage, because he had power in some cases to reject the Clerk, and he did the last act toward giving Possession, which shews how little ground there is to pretend the Patron had any propriety in the Endowments of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Nor was there any such use, as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> pretends, of Clerks resigning at pleasure into the Patrons hand<note n="(w)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes</hi> Chap. 6. p. 89.</note>, for the <hi>Capitulars</hi> he cites to prove this, do not so much as name any Resignation at all, much less any resignation to the Patron; only they forbid Priests to leave their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es without the Bishops consent, and punish those who did so, with Excommunication<note n="(x)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Capit.</hi> lib. 6. cap. 197. &amp; l. 7. cap. 173.</note>; and good reason, for they had made a Promise to the Bishop at their Ordination,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95318:77"/> or Admission, not to leave them<note n="(y)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Capit.</hi> lib. 5. cap. 108.</note>, and so were not only forbid to leave these Churches, but also to take any New ones without the Bishops consent<note n="(z)" place="margin">Ibid. cap. 43, and 82.</note>. Wherefore unless all the prohibitions of good Laws be a proof that the practice prohibited was right before those Laws, these are no evidences, that Patrons had a right to dispose of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es without the Bishops consent; suppose it do imply there was some Patrons and Priests so lawless as to do such things, these Mens facts prove no right at all. But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> saith, <hi>These Laws were little obeyed;</hi> for which we have only his bare word, and (besides that he cannot bring one instance where they were disobeyed, and the party was not punished) it is very unlikely that so many Laws, with so severe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties annexed, should be meer Scare-crows, and never put in execution. But he thinks it proves the Patron had a propriety in the Profits, because <hi>if an Advowson descended in Coparcenary, the Church had as many Incumbents as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceners had parts, as in other Inheritances.</hi> I answer, If this were so, it only shews, that the right of Nomination was divided among the Patrons heirs; but indeed it only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, some would have had it to be thus divided, but the Laws did not allow it, as his own Quotations sufficiently prove. The first of which declares, <hi>It is unfit that one Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar should have divers Priests, and orders the Bishop to forbid Divine Service to be said there, till the Coheirs agree to present one only</hi>

But the case is this, <hi>A certain Ladies first husband had presented a Clerk to a Church upon her Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and the Bishop had approved and admitted him; but upon her divorce and second Marriage, the second husband would have presented another Clerk, on pretence the first hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95318:78"/> presentation was void, because the Marriage was declared null; but the Decree confirms the first Husbands presentation, as having been allowed by the Bishop</hi>

As for those <hi>Droits honorifiques de Signieurs d' Eglises,</hi> of the Patrons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving some part of the Profits to himself, and leaving only a small part to the Incumbent; if there be any such in <hi>France</hi> among Lay-Patrons, they are most likely to have sprung from the old <hi>Infeodations</hi> there. But he tells us, this custome is where the Patron is a Spiritual person, which is no proof that Lay-Patrons had like power, and yet even this very custom in the places he cites to prove it, is condemned as wicked and unjust<note n="(e)" place="margin">Decretal. l 3. tit. 5. c. 30. pag. 1150.

And in other Countries where Parishes were setled, the Tithes may justly be said to be disposed of by the Bishop, because it was Bishops who divided Parishes, consecrated Churches, and received and ratified their Endowments, Bishops gave the Patrons priviledge of Nomination, and confirmed the party nominated to enjoy them, if he liked of him; it was Bishops also that reserved the third or fourth part of Parochial Tithes to their own use, as an acknowledgment of their ancient right to the whole Tithes; so that we may justly say, that even where Parishes were setled also, Tithes were disposed of as the Bishops pleased, and according to the Laws and Canons they had made for that disposal; which utterly destroys his fancy of Lay-mens right to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of Churches.</p>
               <p>The Investiture of Bishops and the more eminent Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots by Emperors and Kings, who anciently were (and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways should have been) supream Ordinaries in their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, was upon the account of several Honours and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral priviledges (not due to them by Gods Law, as Tithes, but) given them by the extraordinary bounty of these Princes, and therefore it is needless to dispute that matter here; only as to Parish Churches it is plain, that if at any time some great and lawless Lay-men had given them by investiture without the Bishops consent, it was a usurpation upon Episcopal right; and if the growing greatness of the Clergy caused it to be taken away, the Clergy therein did but reassume their ancient rights, as that Council at <hi>Rome</hi> (cited here)<note n="(i)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. 6. p. 91.</note> declares, which saith, this practice of the Laity was <hi>contrary to the Statutes of the Holy Fathers</hi>

I do not say that this was never done, but I affirm, that it is certain such disposal of Churches was always illegal and unjust, and I can scarce believe it was done often, because though the Church Laws could not
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95318:79"/> rule the great Lay-men, or hinder them from giving Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; yet they would awe the Clergy, who were to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated for accepting them, and to forfeit both their former Living and this also, which was so unjustly procured<note n="(m)" place="margin">Concil. <hi>Nannetens.</hi> Can. 16. ap. <hi>Bin.</hi> Tom. 3. par. 2. pag. 133.</note>; wherefore he very erroneously saith, the course of Institution upon Presentations succeeded this of investiture, since it cannot be proved that ever investiture of Parish Churches was of common use, and the Bishops power of approving or rejecting the Clerk nominated by the Patron (which answers to our Institution) was as old as <hi>Justinian</hi> at least (as is proved before) and therefore far older than the pretended practice of Investitures. And the very Quotations which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> produces here<note n="(n)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. 6. p. 93.</note> to justifie his Opinion, do rather prove ours, <hi>viz.</hi> That Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitures were a usurpation upon the ancienter rights of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. The first plainly saith; that Investitures were new encroachments upon the Bishops power <hi>by the boldness of some Lay-men</hi>

And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this was the ancient course, only where it was altered in some few places by the injustice of some great Men, new Laws were made to restore the right and ancient use. And thus we have (as briefly as could be) disproved all these pretended Evidences of Lay-mens right to dispose of Tithes, which he hath laboured so earnestly for, in hopes to build his arbitrary Appropriations on this bottom, which being now taken away the Superstructure will more easily fall.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. 6. p. 94.</note>After this tedious circumference Mr. <hi>S.</hi> at last comes to <hi>Appropriations,</hi> whereby indeed not only the Patronage, but the Glebe and Tithe also, of some Churches, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95318:79"/> to Monasteries; but not (as he pretends) by the sole act of Lay-Patrons, for since we have proved they had no propriety in the Endowment, their single act could not settle it in a Monastery; and if they could not present once without the Bishops consent, much less could they convey it for ever: and Mr. <hi>S.</hi> grants, that the Monasteries which had such appropriate Churches, always presented their Clerks to the Bishop for Institution, as the Canons required, and indeed as the Patron had done before the Appropriation. 'Tis true, the Abbies (looking on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as part of the Clergy) did put in Incumbents under the name of Vicars, allowing them but a small part of the profits, while the greatest part of them were reserved to themselves; but this was so notorious a corruption, that <hi>Johan.

                     <hi>Sarisb.</hi> de nugis Curial. l. 7. cap. 17.</note>. And that Age did so fully believe the Bishops interest in all disposal of Tithes, that it was not permitted to Monasteries to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low these Vicars what maintenance they pleased, but the Bishops then had power to give the Vicar such part of the profits as he thought to be fit and competent, as is learnedly and fully proved by Dr. <hi>Ryves,</hi> in his excellent Tract called <hi>The Poor Vicars Plea,</hi> where Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Vicars maintenance being wholly in the will of the Monastery, is so clearly confuted, that I refer the Reader thither; where he may be abundantly satisfied, that no Monastery had any Appropriate Church <hi>Tam pleno jure</hi> so arbitrarily setled in them, but the Bishop had still a power to order them in the disposal of their Tithes: and therefore in that very Bull of Pope <hi>Lucius</hi> the Second, confirming the Appropriate Churches to <hi>Kenilworth</hi> (cited by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> pag. 79) they are granted on these Conditions, First, that their Vicars be presented to the Bishop to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted; Secondly, and that he remain under the Bishops Jurisdiction; Thirdly, that they gave this Vicar a sufficient allowance, which conditions quite overthrow the Monks arbitrary Power in their Appropriate Churches,: and let it be further noted, that the Founders Charter which gives them these Churches is signed by two Bishops, <hi>An.</hi> 1125.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95318:80"/> and the confirmation thereof by K. <hi>Henry</hi> soon after, is signed by his Archbishops and Bishops<note n="(u)" place="margin">Monastic. <hi>Angl.</hi> Tom. 2. p. 114.</note>; so that these Appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations were made at first by the consent of Bishops. But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> observes<note n="(w)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes</hi> Chap. 6. p. 98.</note>, <hi>That Lay-men sometimes made Appropriations, reserving the Patronage to themselves; but then their Presenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were accounted to be only to the Vicariges, which had Salaries annexed at the pleasure of the Monastery on whom the Church was setled in Appropriation.</hi> To which I reply, No Lay-man alone could make an Appropriation, and if they did reserve the Patronage, it was by the Bishops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: But it may be asked, what the Patron had to do with giving <hi>Ecclesiam cum decimis,</hi> since we affirm he had no propriety in the Tithes; and some may think, if his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage were reserved, there was nothing else in him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to give. I reply, It was only the Patronage of the Vicarige which he reserved, as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> here grants: And since he was Guardian of the Church, and so obliged to see the profits disposed of to the fittest Clerks, when the Monks had perswaded Lay-Patrons, that they were the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutest sort of the Clergy, it was requisite the Patron should by his Charter declare his desire and consent, that such a Church should with its profits be setled in such a Monastery; but whatever the words of that Charter were, I shall prove presently (and in the <hi>English</hi> practice) that the Bishop only made the Church appropriate, and as an Evidence of his ancient right in the disposal of Tithes, and of his consent to all Appropriations, the Forms do generally run with this Exception, <hi>Salvis nobis &amp; succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soribus nostris jure &amp; Authoritate Pontificiali</hi>
                  <note n="(x)" place="margin">Monast. <hi>Angl.</hi> T. 2. p. 208.</note>, or as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his instance of the Abby of S. <hi>Germans</hi> hath it, <hi>pag.</hi> 99. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vâ Diocesani Canonicâ justitiâ;</hi> which shews that Lay-Patrons had no arbitrary power in this matter.</p>
               <p>But since Mr. <hi>S.</hi> cannot deny these Charters of Bishops in the Appropriating of Churches, he pretends, <hi>They were only Confirmations got by the Monks to satisfie the Canons, not to give validity to the Grant in secular and Common Law</hi>
                  <note n="(y)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. 6. p. 99.</note>; whereas there was no Secular or Common Law at all then in use which took cognizance of this business, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95318:80"/> the very instance which he brings to prove the Bishops Charters came afterwards, plainly shews it was those very Charters which gave Monks a right to appropriated Churches; for this Charter of King <hi>Lewis</hi> is confessed by himself to have been only a Confirmation of Appropriate Churches and Tithes, which the Monks of <hi>Clugny had gotten, held and possessed</hi> (they are the very words of this Charter of King <hi>Lewis) by the Popes Priviledges, and the Bishops Charters.</hi> Whence it is evident that the Monks first procured the Appropriations, by Grants from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and Bulls from the Pope, by virtue of which they held them, only to prevent any opposition from the Secular Power they desired the Royal confirmation afterward: And when I come to the <hi>English</hi> practice, I shall undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably prove by innumerable Instances, That the Bishops Charters were always had to the first Grant of the Patron, and without them no Lay-man could appropriate any Church, of which this may suffice for a proof at present, That the Lay-Patron did request the Bishop to appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a Church given to the Monks. So <hi>Roger,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester, An.</hi> 1170, having seen the Charter of <hi>Manaster Biset,</hi> who gave, as Patron, the Church of <hi>Kerderminster</hi> to the Nunnery of <hi>Bradley,</hi> and the confirmation of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second; He, <hi>at the request of the said King, and of the Patron, doth confirm their Grant, and ordain it shall be appropriate to them</hi>
                  <note n="(z)" place="margin">Monast. <hi>Angl.</hi> Tom. 2. p. 409.</note>. Further proof of this also Mr. <hi>S.</hi> himself gives us in the next pages<note n="(a)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. 6. p. 100, &amp;c.</note>, where <hi>Bishops</hi> alone do convey Tithes of other Mens Lands to Monasteries, and he instances in <hi>Athelbero,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hamburgh, An.</hi> 1141, and his Successors. And since no example can be produced where Lay-men alone made any such convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, we may thence conclude the Bishops Act was the main thing in all Appropriations. 'Tis true, these <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Bishops (as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> largely proves) had in them from the beginning of Christianity there, the sole right of Tithes through their whole Diocess, because Bishopricks were setled long before Parish Churches in that Country. But this alters not the case, because Bishopricks were setled in all Countries before Parish Churches, and the Bishops had
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95318:81"/> every where of old the sole right of Tithes in them, and though in some Countries the Bishops had consented to the Lay-Patrons power of Nomination and Presenting, and so there they could not so arbitrarily dispose of Parish Tithes to Monasteries, as the <hi>German</hi> Bishops could, yet still even in those Countries the Bishops were to allow and confirm all Grants of Churches and Tithes made by Lay-Patrons to Monasteries for perpetuity, as well as to Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents for life; and if the Bishops were Patrons themselves, they could arbitrarily dispose of them to Monasteries without any Lay-mans consent, which Lay-Patrons could not do: so that in other Countries, as well as in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Bishops had more power in this matter than any Lay-men had. And in <hi>Germany,</hi> even after Parishes were setled, the Bishops seem to have been Patrons of all those Parishes out of which they gave Tithes, and upon that ground <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelbero</hi> gave so many Parish Churches to the Monks, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> p. 103. But I see no ground to believe, either <hi>that Tithes were paid more justly in some of those Northern Churches than in other places;</hi> or, <hi>that in other Countries we shall find arbitrary Consecrations by Lay-men, continued until An.</hi> 1200<note n="(b)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. 6. p. 104.</note>: For as to the latter of these, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> hath not yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced one arbitrary Lay-Consecration in any Country; and as to the former, we see no reason to doubt but Tithes were well paid every where in this Age, yet if these Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Countries paid them so much better than others, it seems strange why Mr. <hi>S.</hi> should only hunt about for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that they paid them unwillingly, and counted them a burden; yet if the more Barbarous of these Nations did despise the Laws of God and Man, and the custom of all Christendom besides, that will be no Precedent for others, and it is evident from the Historians here cited, that this People were as hardly brought to believe the Gospel as to pay Tithes, yet as they received the one so by degrees they submitted to the other. And these very Examples, which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> picked out on purpose to shew some People counted Tithes a burden, do expresly declare, that paying of Tithes was, <hi>according to the custom and example of all Churches, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially of those near them, and that it was a duty by Gods Law.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95318:83"/> done, if the right they claimed had been (as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends) a right of detaining Tithes, since they could not hope to be encouraged by the Pope in so impious a custom: so that we conclude the <hi>Thuringians</hi> rights were, the liberty of paying Tithe to such Abbies as their Fathers had paid them to by Bishops assignation; and they counted it so unjust an exaction for the Bishops Officer to take them, that they broke out into a War upon it, <hi>and afterward</hi> (saith the Historian) <hi>there was no more any exaction of Tithes in Turingia;</hi> that is, the Bishops Officer durst not take them any more; but it is like they paid them afterward to the Abby: for this Historian <hi>Lambertus</hi> (who so highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the <hi>Thuringians</hi>) was a Monk of <hi>Hersfielt,</hi> and a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this cause, which makes him call the paying Tithes to the Bishop <hi>Exactio decimarum;</hi> but when they paid them to the Abby, as before, that he judged to be no exaction: and therefore when the Bishops Officer ceased to take Tithes, he saith, <hi>Tithes were no more exacted there.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither this, nor any other proof yet alledged, doth make out any Arbitrary Power in Lay-men to consecrate or appropriate their Tithes, much less to detain them.</p>

And for the Sense of this Canon it is most like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third designed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all Feudal Tithes past as well as future, for his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh had condemned both sorts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> shews <hi>pag.</hi> 112. and his Successor <hi>Ʋrban</hi> the Second condemned past Infeodations, <hi>ibid. pag.</hi> 113; yea, and Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third so understood this Canon, as he confesses, <hi>pag.</hi> 139. Why then is it unlikely that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Third should condemn old Infeodate Tithes? Mr. <hi>S.</hi> tells us indeed, this Canon did not prevail to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way old Infeodations, but only to prevent new ones, which might be, and yet the Popes design was higher, than (through the power of some great Lay-men) could be brought about. However we gain these two points, That all <hi>Infeodations</hi> were thought Sacrilegious and unjust in the detainers, and yet the first original of them was from the Church, as (Mr. <hi>S.</hi> confesses, <hi>pag.</hi> 178) the <hi>French</hi> Lawyers generally hold and believe; and therefore neither do these <hi>Infeodations</hi> shew any Arbitrary Power the Laity had in disposing Tithes, excepting what they had from the Church.</p>
               <p>He saith, <hi>Perhaps some Old Infeodations were made by Lay-Patrons in the vacancy of their Churches</hi>
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. 6. p. 115.</note>; which is a groundless conjecture, nor can he bring one clear instance of it, and though a Patron with a Bishop may dispose of the Endowment of a Church in the Vacancy, yet it will not follow from thence, that a Patron alone may in the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy dispose of the Endowment to another Lay-man for ever: Nor is there any one passage in <hi>Flodoard,</hi> or <hi>P. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:95318:84"/> that Lay-men without the Bishops consent made any such <hi>Infeodations;</hi> and his Canon of <hi>Innocent</hi> the Second's <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, which orders, <hi>They shall be restored from Lay-men to the Disposition of the Bishop,</hi> doth imply they were in the Disposal of the Bishop first, and by him conferred on Lay-men. I grant indeed, that after Bishops had once made Tithes infeodate, the Laity then, in after Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, did without the Bishops consent give them arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; but we speak of the first conveyance, not of the after derivations. But that grant of <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> of the Chuch of <hi>Egmond, Cum omnibus ad eam jure pertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus,</hi> unto <hi>Thierry</hi> Earl of <hi>Holland, An.</hi> 900, which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> here cites, <hi>pag.</hi> 16. was not properly an Infeodation, but a Grant of a Church with its Endowments to be turned into an Abby; and if we judge of this Act by the use of the time, we may conclude the Bishop consented to this Grant, however we know the Bishops had Infeodated many Churches to the <hi>French</hi> Princes, and they very often gave them back again to Monasteries, as judging they had no good right to them. And Mr. <hi>S.</hi> confesses in the next page, <hi>That Princes often joyned with Bishops to bring in the payment of Tithes, that thereby themselves might have beneficial Infeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of them from the Church</hi>
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 6. p. 117.</note>. So that if Princes themselves were beholding to Bishops for Grants of <hi>Infeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,</hi> we need not wonder how Princes came to have Churches and Tithes to give to Monasteries; and we may be sure if Kings could not make themselve Infeodations without being beholding to the Bishops, no private Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man could make his own Tithes Infeodate, as here Mr. <hi>S.</hi> affirms without one Instance to prove it. As for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt Religious making <hi>Infeodations</hi> out of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesns, confirmed and given to them by Popes and Bishops; First, It is but a secondary Conveyance, and yet even this practice is declared illegal, and the Grant to be null, in that very Decree of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, which he cites to shew there were such Infeodations<note n="(e)" place="margin">Extravag. l. 6. tit. <hi>De De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimis,</hi> cap. 2. §.

The <hi>Decretal</hi> cited in the Margin, doth not imply there were many Examples for it, only saith, <hi>Though it be a grievous thing, and worthy of Divine vengeance, that some Lay-men usurp that which is the Priests right, yet it is most of all to be feared, because they very often are encouraged in their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror by the Clergy, since some Prelates do indulge them to dispose of Churches and Tithes, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note n="(i)" place="margin">Decret. l. 3. Tit. 30. c. 17. pag. 1333.</note>. The blame we see is chiefly laid on the Clergy, and the Sentence subjoyned is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive those Prelates for ever. And good reason, for the Lay-men to whom the Bishops gave these Tithes, spent them in luxury and excess, to the great scandal of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an People; and therefore no wonder if (as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> notes, <hi>pag.</hi> 118.) many of the Country People were by this Male-administration of the Bishops discouraged from paying Tithes. But still here is no proof of any <hi>Infeodations,</hi> but what came from the Bishops, which no way helps Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Opinion, nor are these any instances of Lay-mens Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary detaining or disposing Tithes. We cannot expect but in that Age (as well as in all others) there might be some refractory, covetous, and sacrilegious Persons; but the practice of such being wicked, illegal and condemned, is no pattern for others, nor pretence that they had a right to detain their Tithes.</p>
               <p n="5">§. V. The <hi>Exemptions</hi> granted by the Pope and Bishops to some Religious Orders being so undeniably from the Church, and granted to such as that Age did account among
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95318:85"/> the Clergy, is nothing to Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his purpose. He supposes here that which he hath not proved, <hi>viz. That Lay-men enjoyed a liberty in most places from the beginning of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity till An.</hi> 1200, <hi>in not subjecting themselves to the Laws of the Church for the payment of Tithes, and admitting Canons that touched their Estates, no further than they saw cause</hi>
                  <note n="(k)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 6. p. 119.</note>. We have proved, no such liberty was enjoyed by Lay-men, in any places that were civilized in this part of the world, and have shewed there were Laws of the State, as well as the Church, to oblige them; we have made it out that the Laity were subject both to these Laws and Canons, so that Tithes were now generally paid, and therefore there are more falshoods than lines in this supposition: and all his instances concerning the Clergy, are only about one sort of Clergy-mens paying, or not paying to another, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more but various methods of disposing Tithes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the divers kinds of Clergy, or reputed Clergy; it doth not prove there was any Opinion, that Tithes ought not to be paid by the Laity. He tells us, <hi>some Bishops and Abbots prohibited their husbandmen to pay Tithes to their Parish Churches:</hi> but this was upon supposition, the right of them belonged to themselves as being of the Clergy; yet the Council of <hi>Chalons</hi> condemns this practice, and strictly orders them, <hi>that they should make Tithes of those Fields and Vineyards they possessed, for themselves and their Brethrens stipends, to be paid to the Church, and that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies on their Land should pay Tithes to the Church where they had Sacraments and Prayers</hi>

Tit. 30. c. 2. pag. 1325.</note>. Yet it seems Monks must have paid Tithes to Monks, if they had Lands in the Parish of a Church appropriate to another Abby, unless discharged by mutual consent, as in that composition made by this Pope, between (not the <hi>Templars,</hi> as he mistakes, but) the <hi>Cistercians</hi> and the <hi>Praemonstratenses, An.</hi> 1142; at which time Exemptions were not used, yet they began to be granted soon after, <hi>viz.

So that the practice of <hi>Exemptions</hi> was held unjust by the best Men; and yet the continuance of Exemptions, notwithstanding the injury to the Parish Rectors, and the many complaints amongst them, shews how great a Power the ruling Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy then had in the arbitrary disposal of Tithes, when so unjust and unreasonable practice was continued. But it is objected, <hi>The Templars and Hospitallers were not of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string Clergy, yet they also had Tithes given them.</hi> I Answer, They were accounted the Churches Souldiers, and since <hi>no man goes to war at his own Charges,</hi> they thought they might be paid out of Church Revenues, if the Bishop and his Chapter agreed to it; especially they might be given them in Charity, because these Knights had renounced the World, and so were <hi>Pauperes Voto</hi> as well as the Monks, as Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> declares<note n="(g)" place="margin">Concil. <hi>Trecens.</hi> can. 66. An. 1127. <hi>Bin.</hi> Tom. 3. p. 2. pag. 476.</note>. Yet from this ill practice of the Pope, in exempting Monks and Orders of Spiritual Knights from paying Tithes, came all the Lay-usurpations upon them ever since; and though the one be far more justifiable than the other, yet both deserve to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as contrary to the first end and design of Tithes.</p>

Yet on this ground Mr. <hi>S.</hi> builds many Castles in the Air, which fall of themselves, as soon as this totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foundation is removed, and indeed the <hi>Nona</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cima</hi> (so often named in the <hi>Capitulars</hi>) paid by the Church Tenants do declare, that besides the Ninth part due for rent, that Age believed, the Tenth was of it self due to the Church; and accordingly they paid both <hi>Ninths</hi> and <hi>Tenths,</hi> as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> himself confesses; which, together with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer proofs out of <hi>Hincmarus</hi> and others, do fully shew, that Parochial Tithes were then generally paid in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Imperial Laws then in force. And no wonder, since the Canons of the Church also enjoyned the same thing, as appears by the Councils of <hi>Mentz, Arles, Chalons, Rhemes, Aix, Metz, &amp;c.</hi> cited before §. 6. and to all these were added Pontifical Decrees, which were much regarded about that time; and though Mr. <hi>S.</hi> can find no Papal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree ancienter than that of Pope <hi>Nicholas, An.</hi> 1059<note n="(t)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 6. p. 134.</note>, yet we affirm the three last Books of the <hi>Capitulars</hi> were confirmed by Papal Authority before the year 900<note n="(u)" place="margin">

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95318:90"/> Tithes to be infeodate, or conveyed to Monasteries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such disposition of Tithes would be injurious to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Churches, which were then in possession of them<note n="(i)" place="margin">Concil. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> An. 1180, Can. 9. ap. <hi>Bin.</hi> ibid. pag. 557.</note>; and the exemption of Leprous People from Parochial Tithes, <hi>Can.</hi> 23, is undeniable proof that Parochial Tithes were then commonly claimed and received: so that though none of these Councils purposely command the payment of Parochial Tithes, because there was no need, yet (for all Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his pretences) they all expresly suppose them a duty of common right, and usually paid. But his reason for all this shuffling is to make out an assertion of his Friends, the Common Lawyers, <hi>viz. That before the Council of</hi> Lateran <hi>every Man might have given his Tithes to what Church he would.</hi> A saying that may be true in one sense, <hi>viz.</hi> they might do it with the Bishops and Incumbents consent, both which were by the last named Council of <hi>Lateran, An.</hi> 1180, forbid to consent to any such disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Tithes, and the religious Orders were prohibited to receive them. And this (very likely) was the meaning of the old Lawyers by this their common saying: But as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> expounds it of arbitrary disposal of Tithes by Lay-men, without any consent of the Bishop, it was always false, and he plunges himself into a thousand difficulties to make out this strange fancy; being forced to suppose here, that this last named Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited Religious houses to receive newly created Tithes without the Bishops consent, whereas the Decrees of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Popes, and the History of that time assure us, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church designed long before to cut off that innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lay-mens disposing any sort of Tithes without Episcopal consent, yea even of infeodate Tithes, of which Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third (<hi>Alexanders</hi> Successor, who knew the meaning of this Canon better than Mr. <hi>S.</hi>) expounds the preceding Canon of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> confesses, <hi>pag.</hi> 139; yea he himself thinks it may be meant of infeodate Tithes, <hi>pag.</hi> 146, and therefore we doubt not to conclude that Tithes were paid parochially long before this Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and that there was
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:95318:91"/> no time when Arbitrary Lay Consecrations were allowed or much practiced; for Laws, Practice, and Opinion of this Age, all: agreed to demonstrate they believed Tithes were due to the Clergy <hi>Jure Divino.</hi>

               <p n="8">§. VIII. We might here have concluded this Chapter, but only that in the <hi>Review,</hi> where we might have expected a retractation of some of the Errors and Mistakes of this Chapter Mr. <hi>S.</hi> persists in his Opinions, and asks, <hi>How the Founders of Monasteries could have made Tithes part of their endowment, if Parochial payment were not frequently omitted or continued by Lay-men at their pleasure</hi>
                  <note n="(k)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Seld.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, pag. 467, 468.</note>? I reply, By the consent of Bishops and Popes they might give Tithes to Monasteries, though Parochial payment were not arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and we have proved that Bishops did not only confirm Lay Donations afterwards, but always consented to them at first, and this consent only made them valid. Indeed these Charters of Bishops are sometimes called <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> but they were Confirmations <hi>Non solum ad solennita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, sed ad necessitatem actus,</hi> as the <hi>Canonists</hi> speak; and the Bishops use of the words, <hi>Damus &amp; Concedimus,</hi> very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in those Grants; but the name of a Confirmation properly signifies the Charter of some following Bishops, who having seen the Lay Founder's Grant with his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors Charter, allowing it and making it valid at first, he by a new Charter confirms that which was granted by his Predecessor before. But as for Parochial Tithes, the Grant of them by a Lay-man to any Monastery without the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops consent, was always void, and not only after the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, or the year 1200; as appears by one of his own Instances, <hi>Where Tithes given to a Monastery by a King and Queen of</hi> Hungary, <hi>and confirmed by Pope</hi> Clement <hi>the Third divers years before,</hi> were by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, <hi>An.</hi> 1200, declared to belong still to the Church, to which they were due of old, and the Donation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation are both made void, for want of the Bishops consent at first had<note n="(l)" place="margin">Decret. l. 3. tit. 30. cap. 31. pag. 1347.</note>. But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his other instance of the Donation of the Knight of <hi>Berry,</hi> was a gift of infeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95318:91"/> Tithes with the Bishops consent, which Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> is so far from declaring void (as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> fully pretends) that he expresly declares, for such Tithes, if any Lay-man will give them to a Covent with the Bishops consent, it shall stand firm for ever: so that he utterly mistakes this Decree, it being not of any Parochial Tithes, nor doth the Donation make it void<note n="(m)" place="margin">Decret. l. 3. tit. 10. cap. 7. pag. 1194.</note>. And we may justly wonder at Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his confidence in saying concerning these two Instances, <hi>That every Canonist will acknowledge they were of new Creation,</hi> at least not of <hi>Infeodate Tithes,</hi> when as the former Example is of Tithes anciently <hi>debitas Ecclesiae Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primensi,</hi> and so no New creation: and the latter is expresly said to be meant of <hi>Infeodate Tithes</hi> in the very words of the Decree, and so neither of them prove what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. But if any ask, why Bishops did more frequently dispense with Parochial right before the year 1200, than afterward. I reply, That it was of old believed the sole right of all Tithes in the Diocess were in the Bishop, and while the Monks were poor, and had a great same of Piety, the Bishops often encouraged the Disposal of Tithes to them; but as they grew rich, and Parochial Rectors im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverished by these Grants, it was judged a Male-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, and condemned, and by degrees disused.</p>
               <p>He had told us, <hi>pag.</hi> 70, these arbitrary Lay-Grants were clearly allowed by the Clergy, yet here he saith, <hi>They were practiced against many Canons both Papal and Synodal</hi>

                     <hi>Seld.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, p. 469.</note>; but who can believe the same men did clearly allow, yet frequently condemn the same thing? wherefore we affirm such Grants were never allowed by the Clergy without Ecclesiastical consent. And whereas he pretends the Monks had divers Tithes so granted by Lay-men arbitrarily, for which they (as he saith) cunningly pleaded no Title but <hi>Prescription,</hi> after they perceived the Donation of Lay-men was not allowed without Episcopal consent. I Answer, There would have been no cunning at all in this plea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Prescription was never allowed where the Thing was not fairly come to at first, as is expresly declared by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> in the Example of the Monastery endowed by
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:95318:92"/> the King and Queen of <hi>Hungary,</hi> mentioned just now; for when the Monastery pleaded Prescription, it was said, <hi>No Prescription could have beginning from a Lay Donation; and because no Lay-man could give that to another which he had no right to himself, therefore the plea of Prescription was not allowed, and the Donation is made void</hi>
                  <note n="(o)" place="margin">Decret. l. 3. Tit. 30. cap. 31.</note>. And the <hi>Decretals</hi> cited by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> in the Margen speak not of Prescription ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Lay-Grants, or pleaded by Monks against Parochial right, but of Prescription pleaded by one Parish Church against another<note n="(p)" place="margin">Decret. l. 2. tit. 26. cap. 6. pag. 933. &amp;c. 8. p. 934.</note>; and one of them expresly saith, <hi>No Prescription can be grounded on a Lay-Donation</hi>
                  <note n="(q)" place="margin">Decret. l. 2. tit. 26. cap. 7.</note>; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, "In prescription of Ecclesiastical profits, <hi>bona fides &amp; justus titulus exigatur</hi>
                  <note n="(r)" place="margin">Ibid. c. 17. pag. 498.</note>. Therefore unless the Lay Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation were confirmed by a Bishop originally, it is evident Prescription could not be pleaded in bar to Parochial right. But at last, after all these attempts to prove arbitrary Lay Consecrations, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> complains, <hi>He cannot find in the Leiger Books, or ancient Libels, any title to Tithes derived from these Arbitrary Consecrations, nor is there a formulary of any Libel in</hi> Durandus <hi>that touches this kind of Grants</hi>

                     <hi>Seld.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, p. 470.</note>. And no wonder, for there never were any such Arbitrary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrations, but in Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his imagination; so that he truly confesseth this Doctrine is new, and never pointed at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and therefore 'tis not strange that the poor Monks 400 years ago (never dreaming of this New invention) did not draw their claims to Tithes by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Novel Scheme; yea 'tis a little hard he should condemn them for unjustly concealing their Lay Benefactors bounty, since they do in their Leiger Books frequently mention Lay-Donors of Tithes, but withal they also record the Bishops consent which made them valid, and the true reason why they set down no Tithes given them only by the gift of Lay-men, is, because there was no such thing. His dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course about <hi>Appropriations</hi> wholly relies on this false foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation also, that divers of them were made by Lay-Patrons alone; which I have disproved before, and therefore shall only remark, that he grants here <hi>even a dedication of Tithes to Gods service, if it had been made by a Lay-man at first,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:95318:92"/> makes them so sacred, that no Lay-man can ever after have a good Title to them in Equity and Conscience, which he would have our Impropriators seriously to consider, since it is destruction to a man to devour that which is holy.</hi> The Exhortation of <hi>Gerold,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> to those of the Desarts of <hi>Wagria,</hi> to pay Tithes<note n="(t)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Seld.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, p. 472.</note>, is not so very contemptible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Age he lived in, and may be justified if taken in a Latitude allowable to all popular discourses; and however the encroaching Monks might scoff the Bishops, as if they went from the business in hand, when they turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their discourse to reprove them for unjust taking away Parochial Tithes. I am sure there was great need to put a stop to that growing mischief, which had so impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished the Parish Rectors in that Age, as might in time have ruined Religion it self. As for <hi>Infeodations</hi> coming from the Church at first, he brings nothing new to disprove it here, but confesses it was believed so very anciently, and brings one good Argument to confirm it was really true, <hi>viz.</hi> That no Tithes are paid to the Church out of any such Infeodations which would sometimes have been claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but only that these Tithes now alienated by Infeoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Bishops consent, were the very same Tithes which had first belonged to the Church; and Mr. <hi>S.</hi> (who never yet produced one clear Example of any Infeodation that did not originally come from the Church) here gives one clear instance out of <hi>Ivo</hi>'s 289 Epistle of an Infeoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by a Bishop: So that reason, authority, Laws and history of practice do thus far declare, that Tithes were ever reputed to belong to the Church.</p>

               <p n="1">§. I. THis Chapter Mr. <hi>S.</hi> begins with a confession, that Parochial right became now to be more established<note n="(u)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 7. p. 141.</note>; but he commits two great mistakes, and both grounded upon his old erroneous Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Lay-mens arbitrary disposal of Tithes, <hi>viz. First,</hi> That Parochial right owed its original to the Canon Law, whereas we have proved it was in use long before it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it was a Usurpation upon the Laities arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power of giving Tithes, introduced by the Papal power; whereas all that the Pope did in this matter, was to retrench the Laity from usurping upon the ancient and undoubted right of the Bishops, and to restore the old usage of regular Parochial payment; wherefore the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of those Councils of <hi>Lateran</hi> forbidding Infeodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and receiving Tithes from Lay-mens gifts, without the Bishops consent, mentioned by Mr. <hi>S.</hi>
                  <note n="(w)" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 142, 143.</note>, were but a restauration of the Churches just and ancient right; and since he grants Parochial Tithes, were in the beginning of this Period claimed as due <hi>De jure communi</hi>

It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from this they had been setled by Law long before, yet Mr. <hi>S.</hi> whose business now is not historically to relate the manner of paying Tithes, but sophistically to dispute against regular payment, runs back into the time before <hi>An.</hi> 1200, to shew that Parochial payment was little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served then; but his Proofs are utterly insufficient. The Covenants which Bishops and Monks took from their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, not to pay Parochial Tithes, are no evidence that the Laity did not pay them, and they clearly shew Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Tithes were demanded then, even of the Clergy who had Land in other Parishes, or else what need of these
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95318:93"/> Covenants; and this practice is condemned in the Council of <hi>Chalons, An.</hi> 813, (400 years before the beginning of this Period) and there it is decreed, <hi>That notwithstanding these Covenants the Tenants of Bishops and Abbots should pay Tithes to the Church where they heard Divine Service</hi>

So that Parochial right prevailed against such Covenants many hundred years before this Period began. And if Exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> saith were got about <hi>An.</hi> 1100) did make some Monks presume to renew this unjust practice, yet he confesses it was remedied in the General Council of <hi>Lateran, An.</hi> 1215, and indeed it was prohibited in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, <hi>An.</hi> 1160<note n="(z)" place="margin">Append. ad Concil. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> par. 13. c. 6. ap. <hi>Bin.</hi> Tom. 3. par. 2. p. 598.</note>, that is, as soon almost as this ill usage began to revive; but Mr. <hi>S.</hi> puts that quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation very cunningly into his Margen, and cites only in his Discourse the Council nigh 50 years later. His second instance, of the Archbishop of <hi>Matera</hi> complaining to the Pope, That the Tenants of some religious Persons would not pay their Parochial Tithes, makes strongly for us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that very Decree saith, <hi>It appears Tithes were fully paid in former times, while these Lands were in the hands of Lay-men, and therefore he decrees they shall be fully paid henceforth to the Churches to which they are due</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Epist. Decr. <hi>Innocent.</hi> l. 2. pag. 483.</note>. So that this Decree shews Parochial payment preceded this usurpation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores an old due unjustly interrupted for a while. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Council of <hi>Tribur</hi> doth not suppose Men had a liberty to make any Church their Parish, by paying Tithes thither; but it supposes Men did constantly pay their Tithes, while living, to their own Parish Church, and therefore it orders them to be buried there when they died<note n="(b)" place="margin">Concil. <hi>Tribur.</hi> Can. 15. An. 895. <hi>Bin.</hi> T 3. p. 2. pag. 214.</note>; yea the very Canon before <hi>Can.</hi> 14. doth expresly decree, that Tithes shall be paid to the old Parish Church. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> 'Tis true <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, <hi>An.</hi> 1180, would not determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Predial Tithes should be paid to the Church in whose Territory the Land lay, or to that Church in whose Parish the Owner lived; but this very doubt supposes Parochial right agreed upon, and that it was certain Tithes must be paid to some Parish Church, the only question is, when two Churches claim the same Tithe, to which it shall be
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95318:94"/> assigned<note n="(c)" place="margin">Decret. l. 3. Tit. 30. c. 18. pag. 1334.</note>. Yet even this was decided presently after, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>An.</hi> 1182, P. <hi>Lucius</hi> ordered, that Predial Tithes should be paid where the Land lay, and Personal Tithes where the Party dwelt<note n="(d)" place="margin">Ibid. c. 20. pag. 1335.</note>; wherefore Mr. <hi>S.</hi> most unjustly infers from these Doubts, that <hi>Parochial right was not so much as in Opinion established about the Year</hi> 1200<note n="(e)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Seld.</hi> hist. Tithes, ch. 7. p. 146.</note>, whereas if there had not been a general opinion of Parochial right, there could have been no such doubts. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree enjoyning the Monks of <hi>Boxley</hi> to pay Parochial Tithes, was not made by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, but by his Predecessor <hi>Adrian</hi> the Fourth, <hi>An.</hi> 1155; and if this pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been enjoyned <hi>because they were wont to be paid fully before the Monks came thither;</hi> that would shew that Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial payment was become a custom before the year 1144, when <hi>Boxley</hi> Abby was founded<note n="(f)" place="margin">Monastic. <hi>Angl.</hi> T. 1. pag. 827.</note>, and as well in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places as there, for ought appears to the contrary in the <hi>Decretal:</hi> Yet the best Copy of that Decree reads o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, and grounds not the Order on any Custom, but saith, <hi>The Bishop shall compel those Monks to pay Tithes as fully as they had been paid before they came into that Parish</hi>
                  <note n="(g)" place="margin">Decret. l. 3. Tit. 30. cap. 4. pag. 1327.</note>. So that here we see Parochial right prevailed against the Monks pretences long before that General Council of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran,</hi> which he would perswade us first fixed that right. And now at length Mr. <hi>S.</hi> grants, what he disputed so hotly against <hi>pag.</hi> 138, 139. <hi>viz.</hi> That the aforesaid Canon of that <hi>Lateran</hi> Council was not concerning Parochial Tithes, but only concerning passing Feodal Tithes out of Lay hands to the Church, and in that case the Bishops consent was sufficient to make such a Conveyance good; but not to make good a Lay donation of Parochial Tithes: which abundantly proves Parochial right was not setled in that <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, but established long before; and we have Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his own confession in the end of this Section, <hi>pag.</hi> 149, <hi>That this Council did not directly constitute Parochial right, but rather supposed it as of former time.</hi> Wherefore it is to no purpose for him to bring in that gross mistake of his dull Monkish Historians, who say, that Pope <hi>Gregory, An.</hi> 1274, in the Council of <hi>Lyons</hi> first ordained, <hi>That no
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:95318:94"/> man should assign his Tithes at his own will, as formerly, but should pay them all to his Parish Church:</hi> for this was consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted long before, and Mr. <hi>S.</hi> grants therere is no such matter to be found in that Council of <hi>Lyons,</hi> out of which they pretend to take it; so that it must pass for a mistake of the Monks, unless they mean it of that <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, which allowed not such disposals of Parochial Tithes, no not with the Bishops consent, because they found the inconvenience of impoverishing Parish Churches to enrich Monasteries, so that indeed after this <hi>Lateran</hi> Council Parochial right was more strictly observed than before. But as for what he cites out of a <hi>Spanish</hi> Council, <hi>An.</hi> 1322, concerning the liberty which Men had then in the Diocess of <hi>Palentia,</hi> to declare themselves of what Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish they would, it is nothing to other Countries; for the reason is given in that very Council, <hi>viz. Because as yet no certain limits had been assigned to Parishes there</hi>
                  <note n="(h)" place="margin">V. Concil. ap. <hi>Bin.</hi> T. 3. par. 2. p. 811, 812.</note>; but in <hi>Italy, France, Germany,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> there were Parishes limited many hundred years before; wherefore there Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial right was setled of ancient time, and from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this four hundred years very generally and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly observed.</p>
               <p n="2">§. II. The Opinions of this Age are less considerable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we have already related the sounder Doctrine of the Holy Fathers, in times of more Learning and Integrity, and therefore the Canonists Opinion is most to be valued because it is grounded upon the sayings of Fathers and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of old Councils, and so comes nearest to the sense of the Primitive Ages: and Mr. <hi>S.</hi> confesses<note n="(i)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 7. p. 150.</note>, they do generally hold <hi>Tithes</hi> are due <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> nor do they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cite the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, but divers places of the Gospel also to prove it<note n="(k)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rebuffus</hi> de Decimis, qu. 1. p. 13, &amp; alii.</note>. 'Tis true, the dependance they had on the Pope inclines them to give him too much power, (as in other things, so) in the disposition of this Sacred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, and hence they justifie Alienations, Appropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Exemptions by Papal Authority, especially if the Bishop consent thereto. By which we may learn, that the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:95318:95"/> ill practice of the former Age in conveying Tithes to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries, and exempting them, is no certain proof that Tithes were not held due by Gods Law in those times, for the <hi>Canonists</hi> generally hold them <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and yet allow that practice. And now we shall only make two or three remarks on what Mr. <hi>S.</hi> saith of this point: <hi>First,</hi> He confesseth, Parochial right was so setled in this Age, that the Parson need make no other Title to Tithes, but only to prove they grew in his Parish, <hi>pag.</hi> 151. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it was taken for granted by the <hi>Canonists,</hi> that S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> were clear for the right of Tithes, since their sayings were cited as Law in this matter. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> These <hi>Canonists</hi> generally disallow all Customs to do diminish the <hi>Quota,</hi> as being contrary to Gods Law, <hi>p.</hi> 153. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And they generally hold all Feudal Tithes came from the Church at first, and cannot now be retained in Lay hands, but ought to be restored.</p>
               <p n="3">§. III. The Opinion of the School-men, as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> saith, was, <hi>That only a Competency is due to the Clergy by the Divine Moral Law, the</hi> quota <hi>of a Tenth being but of Ecclesiastical Institution</hi>

But we must observe, these School-men were generally Monks, who cunningly invented this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to spoil the Parochial Rectors of their Tithes, or however to get a Maintenance out of the People, besides what they paid to their Parsons; for <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Hales,</hi> the first Author of this distinction, about <hi>An.</hi> 1230, was a <hi>Franciscan</hi> Fryer, and in that very place where he disputes this point, he concludes thus, <hi>Therefore we are obliged now to give as large a quantity or larger—Christians are bound to give this or more, if they will enter into the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>

                  <note n="(n)" place="margin">Secund. 2. qu. 1. art. 1.</note>; implying, this was the lowest mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; but that men were bound to give more, that is, (we must suppose) give to the Fryers beside the Tithe paid to the Parish Rector: But when the Monks found the Pope and greater Clergy inclinable to exempt Monasteries, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95318:95"/> endow them with Tithes taken from Parish Rectors, they thought nothing could better defend them in these unjust possessions, than this device of making Tithes to be of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Institution; for thus they could answer <hi>Petrus Blesensis, Sarisburiensis,</hi> and others, who had opposed this Practice, as being a dispensing with the Law of God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, this Opinion served to defend them in the enjoying of Parish Churches and Tithes, only assigning a small por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Vicar or Ministring Priest there, (a Practice which had its original from the Monks) and this they called <hi>Competens beneficium; The Monasteries</hi> (saith <hi>Hales) ought to assign a competent benefit to him that Ministers the Sacrament, or else they are Robbers of the Church, and unjustly detain Tithes</hi>

                     <hi>Alens.</hi> m. 16. art. 2.</note>. From this Opinion also sprang divers other pernicious consequences, as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> himself observes, <hi>The opinion of Tithes, being meer Alms,</hi> (he saith) <hi>sprang from hence</hi>
                  <note n="(p)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 7. p. 166.</note>, <hi>and Customs of paying less, yea of paying nothing, were hence allowed</hi>
                  <note n="(q)" place="margin">Ib. p. 164.</note>. This Doctrine also is pleaded to take away the Jurisdiction of Tithes from the Church, and to justifie the Alienation of them<note n="(r)" place="margin">Ib. p. 181.</note>. Wherefore this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion being invented for base ends, and the maintaining it producing such mischievous effects, ought by all means to be exploded. But we may be sure Mr. <hi>S.</hi> will be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully kind to an Opinion tending so evidently to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Right of Tithes, and therefore he pleads, <hi>That</hi> Hales <hi>was not the first Author of it, but that those Ancients who speak of</hi> Lex Divina, &amp; Deus praecepit, &amp;c. <hi>means no more than</hi> Lex Ecclesiastica, &amp; Ecclesia praecepit<note n="(s)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 7. p. 159.</note>. This he infers first from the Practice of the time, in consenting to <hi>Appropriations, &amp;c.</hi> which he thinks in Conscience they could not have done, if they had believed Tithes were due by Gods Law; but we have so fully shewed how that Practice and this Opinion was reconciled in that Age, that this Exception signifies nothing. And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> if any of the Late Doctors, who follow this Opinion of the School-men, would gladly strain the Fathers expressions (as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> here doth) and force them to seem of their own side, it is no wonder, since all novel Errors usually seek the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95318:96"/> of Antiquity. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Therefore we will examine the places of the Ancients, and shew that <hi>Lex Divina</hi> in them doth not signifie <hi>Lex Ecclesiastica,</hi> as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> asserts. Not only <hi>Major,</hi> but <hi>Bellarmin</hi> also alledges, that S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith <hi>Lent</hi> was <hi>Divinitus instituta,</hi> which yet they suppose means no more, but that it was of Ecclesiastical Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="(t)" place="margin">Major ad 4. sent. dist. 15. qu. 3. <hi>Bellarm.</hi> de Clericis, l. 4. c. 24.</note>, and this they apply to the sayings of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients concerning Tithes: Yet the same <hi>Bellarmine</hi> else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where cites this very phrase of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> to prove <hi>Lent</hi> was instituted by Christ<note n="(u)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarm.</hi> de verbo Dei scripto, l. 4. c. 9.</note>, which indeed seems to be S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his true meaning, only this shews <hi>Bellarmines</hi> hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, who turns these phrases as he pleaseth to serve a present turn. But it seems Mr. <hi>S.</hi> could not find any Author long before <hi>Hales</hi> who so used this Phrase, for his first instance is but of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, <hi>An.</hi> 1180, who speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a prescription of Tithes saith, <hi>De jure divino &amp; humano melior est conditio possidentis;</hi> but whatever his MSS.

Wherefore I think he means plainly, <hi>They are received by virtue of Gods Law;</hi> and if this seem to contradict his former Opinion, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that is no wonder, for elsewhere he saith, <hi>Non cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit Sacramentum Decimarum quia de Lege Naturae, maximè fuit</hi>

As for the Council of <hi>Lateran, An.</hi> 1215, it was in <hi>Hales</hi> his time, and however the phrase <hi>Lex Divina</hi> be used there, it will not thence appear it was anciently used so (which is that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> was to prove;) nor yet is it clear that those words of that Council, <hi>Decimae—quae debentur ex Lege divinâ, vel loci censuetudine approbatâ</hi>

And indeed all the liberty this Author means, is a liberty to give more than a Tenth (as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> held of old,) for he is plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that Tithes were due by Gods Laws now; <hi>Tithes</hi> (saith he) <hi>are so instituted from the beginning, that they could never be alienated without sin — for they are reserved under the Law of Grace for the Ministers maintenance—so that it is Sacriledge for any to retain them, but those to whose main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance they were ordained by Divine Institution</hi>

We conclude therefore, that the School-men and Monks did first alter that, which was the Currant Doctrine of the Church about <hi>An.</hi> 1200, for a little before <hi>Ʋrban</hi> the Third said, <hi>Tithes are known to be granted to the Ministers of the Church, as well by the Old as the New Law</hi>

               <p n="4">§. IV. The Spawn of the former Doctrine was the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Mendicant</hi> Fryers, who taught, <hi>that Tithes were
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95318:97"/> meer Alms, not due by any right to the Parish Ministers, and might be disposed of or retained at the Owners pleasure</hi>
                  <note n="(m)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 7. p. 165.</note>. But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> explodes this Doctrine as a base design meerly to get Tithes from the Secular Clergy, and to excuse their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them in Lands belonging to their Monasteries; and he tells us withal, that <hi>Innocent</hi> the Fourth writ against these new Teachers, <hi>as preaching against both the Old and New Testament, An.</hi> 1240. He brings in also <hi>Richardus Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machanus, An.</hi> 1350, as greatly complaining of them, noting withal, that <hi>Wicklief, Brute,</hi> and <hi>Thorp,</hi> followed these Fryers in this point, whose Arguments Mr. <hi>S.</hi> doth not think worth the relating, nor I the confuting. The Council of <hi>Constance</hi> (following in this, the Primitive Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons against the <hi>Eustathian</hi> Hereticks) justly condemned these Innovators; and though the <hi>Bohemians</hi> agreed with these in denying the right of Tithes, it is to be observed, they had first spoiled the Clergy of all their Possessions, and then could not defend their Sacriledge, but by this specious Error. <hi>Erasmus</hi> it seems was at first inclined to this Opinion; but since he received a Parsonage in <hi>Kent,</hi> and took Tithes there afterward, there is no doubt but he recanted his former Principles, which is all I observe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter.</p>
               <p n="5">§. V. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> had told us before, <hi>pag.</hi> 150, that the first Opinion was that of the <hi>Canonists,</hi> who held Tithes due <hi>by the Divine Moral Law;</hi> yet now he reckons as a Third Opinion, <hi>That Tithes, as to the</hi> Quota, <hi>are due from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Divine Natural Law</hi>

There were in <hi>France</hi> good Laws, Civil as well as Ecclesiastical, to oblige all Tithes to be restored to the Church, and their Lawyers (who should best understand this matter) do affirm, that all Infeodate Tithes in <hi>France</hi> first came from the Church, for which cause the Clergy there owe it to their Predecessors ill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, that these Lands pay no Tithes parochially.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:95318:99"/> before whom the cause lay; but Mr. <hi>S.</hi> ought not to call the disallowing this bad Custom, <hi>a usurpation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons upon the Secular Law;</hi> for these modern Secular Laws and Customs had rather usurped upon the old Civil Laws and Canons too, and when the juster and ancienter Laws took place, it cannot be called Usurpation.</p>

He confesseth, that the Tithes which are in the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> or that have been infeodated by those Kings, were granted by the Pope, and that <hi>Cum onere dotandi Ecclesias,</hi> on condition to endow the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es other ways, which was indeed an unfit exchange, but not plain robbery; and still those infeodate Tithes retain the marks of their coming from the Church, since divers of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Lawyers hold, that the connisance of them belongs only to the Spiritual Jurisdiction. <hi>Pag.</hi> 186. And it is but, <hi>quandoque,</hi> sometimes that these Causes are tried before the Kings Judges, and it's likely but of late years, for the oldest instance Mr. <hi>S.</hi> can bring is dated but <hi>An.</hi> 1525; for there were not only Canons, but Civil Laws also in that Country, (<hi>pag.</hi> 185) which decreed on the Churches side, though evil Customs it seems bore them down there, as well as elsewhere. <hi>Pag.</hi> 188. That Infeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Tithes belonging to the Family of the <hi>Mutii</hi> at <hi>Piacenza,</hi> was probably derived from the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was confirmed by the Pope. The Ordinance of the Emperor <hi>Frederic</hi> (which I cited before §. 3.) clearly declares Tithes are due by the Law of God, and this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage cited by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> owns them due to the Churches; and the reason why they are appointed to be paid in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they were in the time of King <hi>William,</hi> is because they were then well and generally paid. <hi>Pag.</hi> 190. The Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> indeed speaks of some Foreiners min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled among the Nations about <hi>Italy,</hi> who pretended Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of Non-payment; but the Canon saith, <hi>They scarce deserve the name of Christians,</hi> and enjoyns them, contrary to so wicked a Custom, to pay Tithes according to the Law of God, and the Custom of the Western Nations: and if
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:95318:100"/> these mixt People were <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> yet surely the Law of God, and usage of all Western Nations, ought to prevail over their evil Customs; but we have proved before, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> did pay Tithes of old, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not likely to be meant of them. <hi>Pag.</hi> 191. The liberty of Non-payment of Tithes of waste-grounds in <hi>Poland</hi> for 30 years, was granted by the Bishop of <hi>Cracovia,</hi> and he that hath a right, may abstain from using it in some cases and for some time, if he please. <hi>Pag.</hi> 192. As for <hi>Scotland,</hi> I appeal to the History of that Church to shew by what ill practices (in the hurry of a Reforming humor) Tithes were taken from the Church there, and how much Mr. <hi>Knox,</hi> and other Advisers of that project, repented thereof when it was too late. <hi>Pag.</hi> 193. But the strangest thing of all this Chapter is, that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> should confidently produce a late confirmation (by <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> (afterward King of <hi>Scotland) An.</hi> 1290) of an old settlement of some Churches on a Monastery; as if it were an instance of an Original Appropriation made by a Lay-man long after the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council: whereas the <hi>Monasticon</hi> will inform us, these Churches were appropriate to that Monastery by the Ancestors of this <hi>Robert</hi> 140 years before; and this Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> cites is nothing but a confirmation of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Grants. These Churches were first assigned to the Priory of <hi>Giseburn</hi> by the Son of the Founder <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> Lord of <hi>Anandale, circ. An.</hi> 1150; and the old Bishops of <hi>Durham</hi> had appropriated such of them as were in that Diocess to these Monks of <hi>Giseburn,</hi> as appears by a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the <hi>Monasticon</hi>

But this <hi>Robert</hi> Lord of <hi>Anandale,</hi> the Second of that name, was Father of <hi>William Bruce,</hi> and he Father of <hi>Robert</hi> the Third (whose Charter of Confirmation to these
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95318:100"/> very Churches is yet extant<note n="(o)" place="margin">Monastic. p. 152. circ.

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the <hi>English</hi> Laws for Tithes.</head>
               <p n="1">§. I. THE Laws and Practice of <hi>England</hi> in point of Tithes were put by themselves, because they chiefly concern us, and because they are fuller and were better observed than in most other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but Mr. <hi>S.</hi> begins too late, omits many, and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits some of those he produces, wherefore for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting this Collections of Laws we will add what is wanting, and vindicate what is unjustly disparaged with all the brevity we can. If we look back to the first Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> it will appear very probable that Tithes were paid among them as soon as Christianity it self was setled; for in the Laws of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, after the enumeration of all kind of things whereof Tithes
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95318:101"/> are to be paid, it is said, <hi>Haec enim praedicavit B.</hi> Augustinus, <hi>&amp; concessa sunt à Rege, baronibus &amp; populo</hi>
                  <note n="(p)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Spelm.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. T. 1. p. 620.</note>, and an old Manuscript of these Laws hath this Marginal Note there, <hi>Of the preaching of S.</hi> Augustine <hi>the Apostle of</hi> England: And this very <hi>Augustine</hi> the Monk, is called S. <hi>Augustinus</hi> in ancient Record<note n="(q)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lambard. Archaionom.</hi> p. 137.</note>; so that it is very likely this is meant of the preaching of <hi>Augustine</hi> the Monk, and the Grant of King <hi>Ethelbert</hi> his Barons and People, <hi>An.</hi> 600. for neither did the Father S. <hi>Augustine</hi> preach for the payment of all the particulars there enumerated, nor can his preaching many hundred years before be well applied to the Grants of any of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings. Nor is it unlikely, that Tithes were paid here in <hi>Augustines</hi> time, because he came from <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> where we have shewed they were well paid long before; and we have noted, that <hi>Rupertus,</hi> the Apostle of the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> perswaded that People to pay Tithes above 60 years before the Conversion of <hi>England;</hi> yea an old Historian relates, <hi>That a certain Fisherman, who lived in S.</hi> Augustines <hi>time, constantly offered the Tithe of his Fishing to the Church of S.</hi> Peters, Westminster, <hi>and obliged his Heirs to do the same, which they had continued to do till the days of</hi> Edward <hi>the Confessor</hi>

Since therefore Tithes were then paid, it is very likely there might be a Law made for it, and 'tis probable, that Law of King <hi>Ethelbert</hi> against the taking away <hi>res Ecclesiae,</hi> (or as it is in <hi>Saxon) Gods Fee</hi>

An. 610.</note>, must be expounded of Tithes also, which the <hi>Saxons</hi> usually called <hi>Gods Right,</hi> or <hi>Gods Fee.</hi> But it is certain, that Tithes were ordinarily paid here about 140 years after; for <hi>Boniface,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> in his Epistle to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> expresly saith, <hi>The Clergy here did receive the Wool and Milk of Christs sheep, in the daily Oblations and</hi> Tithes <hi>of the Faithful</hi>

                     <hi>Spelm.</hi> C n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. T. 1. p. 264.</note>. All these I say may very reasonably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of <hi>Tithes,</hi> which undoubtedly were paid to the Church in that Age.</p>
               <p>But the first Laws now extant which mention them by name, are the Canons collected by <hi>Egbert,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> (Brother to <hi>Eadbert</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland) An.</hi> 750. in the very time of <hi>Boniface,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> the Fourth of which Canons <hi>Commands the Priest to teach the People how to pay Tithes:</hi> The Fifth <hi>appoints him that receives them, to keep a Register of the Names of such as paid them, and to divide them according to Canonical Authority before Witnesses.</hi> The 24th forbids taking <hi>Tithes</hi> from ancient Churche: The 25th, That Priests should do no Secular service for <hi>Tithes:</hi> The 99th is the Precept of <hi>Moses</hi> Law; and the 100th, the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> for Tithes. This being so full and so ancient Authority, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> labours by all means to discredit it: First, <hi>Because some of these Canons are the same syllables with the</hi> French <hi>Capitulars, made</hi> 30 <hi>years after</hi> Egberts <hi>death</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 8. p. 197.</note>. To which I reply, That though it be so in some few of them, yet there is no reason to suspect these Collections taken out of the <hi>Capitulars,</hi> but great cause to believe the <hi>Capitulars</hi> were taken out of these Collections; for <hi>Alcuinus,</hi> Tutor to <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, who advised and assisted in the making of the <hi>French</hi> Capitulars, was <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> Scholar; and when this <hi>Alcuine</hi> was to collect mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the <hi>Capitulars, Malmsbury</hi> tells us, he writ to <hi>Charles, That he might have books of exquisite Scholastical Learning, such as he had in his own Country, by the pious and devout industry of his Master.</hi> Egbert, <hi>the Archbishop—and that the King would send some Youths into</hi> Britain, <hi>to bring into</hi> France <hi>the choice Collections that were there</hi>
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Malms.</hi> de gest. Pontif. l. 3. pag. 153.</note>. And the same Author there describes <hi>Egbert, as a Magazine of all liberal Arts, a great Lover and Collector of Books, having set up a most noble Library at</hi> York. Which makes it very plain, that <hi>Charles</hi> the Great had a Copy of these Collections before he made
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:95318:102"/> his <hi>Capitulars,</hi> and therefore it is no wonder if the very words of these Canons be transcribed there. Secondly, Whereas the Fifth of <hi>Egberts</hi> Canons speaks of, <hi>dividing Tithes according to Canonical Authority before Witnesses:</hi> Mr. <hi>S.</hi> objects, <hi>That there was no Canonical Authority for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding Tithes before Witnesses, till an Imperial made in the</hi> 11th <hi>year of</hi> Charles <hi>the Great, long after</hi> Egberts <hi>death</hi>
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 8. p. 198.</note>. But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> grosly mistakes this Imperial, for it only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points, <hi>That if any difference arise between the Priest and his Parishioner, whether Tithes were paid or no, Four or Eight ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men shall be chosen, to witness between the Priest and People, whether the Parishoner did give his Tithes or no</hi>
                  <note n="(e)" place="margin">Edit. vit. <hi>Amberbach.</hi> c. 7. Leg. <hi>Longob.</hi> lib. 3. tit. 3.</note>; but this is nothing at all to that Canonical division of Tithe (already received) into four Parts, which <hi>Egberts</hi> Law saith, is to be done before Witnesses. The <hi>Imperial</hi> speaks of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses between Priests and People at the paying of Tithes; but <hi>Egbert</hi> treats of Witnesses, to see that Priests rightly distributed the Tithe already paid; which shews the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency of this allegation, and Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his desire to feign seeming Objections when he wants real ones: Which ill dealing of his will still be plainer when we observe, there was good Canonical Authority before <hi>Egberts</hi> time for thus dividing, Tithes received, before Witnesses. The Council of <hi>Antioch, An.</hi> 341, orders, <hi>That the Bishop do make the Priest and Deacons acquainted with the Goods of the Church, and do not distribute them without their knowledge</hi>
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">Concil. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</hi> Can 24.</note>. Pope <hi>Gelasius</hi> also had decreed, <hi>That the distribution should be attested by the notification of Witnesses present at it, An.</hi> 494<note n="(g)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gelas.</hi> Ep. l. 1. c 29.</note>.

Wherefore this was a thing enjoyned by the Canons long before <hi>Egberts</hi> time. and we may conclude both, that these Canons were the genuine Collections of <hi>Egbert,</hi> and that they are good proof, that Tithes were paid here by virtue of these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons as anciently as the year 750.</p>

I know not for what reason Mr. <hi>S.</hi> here puts the Son before the Father, and the Year 878 before 858; but we must rectifie the order, and begin with the famous Charter of King <hi>Ethelwolph,</hi> the first hereditary sole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the <hi>English Saxons</hi> reigning peaceably, and so the First who could make a general Law to bind the whole Kingdom to pay Tithe, which by Canons and particular Laws of some Provinces was paid in many places before. As for this Law, it was made in a General Council of the whole Kingdom, or (as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> speaks) <hi>by the Parliamentary consent of that time;</hi> and since it is too much to cite at large; we will take Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his account of it, who saith, <q>The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

The Laws of <hi>Edward</hi> the First give good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies against detainers of Parochial Tithes, but they allow some sort of Customs further than can be justified by Men, who in the Preface to this Act declare, <hi>Tithes are due to God:</hi> for if so, no Custom which defrauds God of that due, in whole or in part, ought to be allowed. And for that reason those Ecclesiastical Canons, collected by Eight of our most famous Men of all Learned Professions about that time, Two Bishops, Two Doctors of Divinity, Two Doctors of Civil Law, and Two Common Lawyers, have declared, these Customs ought utterly to be abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated; but since this Collection was never passed into a Law (which is much to be lamented) it only remains a Testimony of the Opinion of our most Judicious Persons at the Reformation, concerning the payment of Tithes: And the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Cowel,</hi> of later time, hath declared himself of the same Opinion, as to the reasonableness of abrogating all such Customs as do lessen the Tenth part due to the Church by the Law of God<note n="(e)" place="margin">

                  </note>. But 'tis time to conclude this Chapter, which hath shewed, That <hi>Tithes,</hi> which God first taught, and inspired Patriarchs paid, which were enjoyned under the Law, and not repealed, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired under the Gospel; which were held to be due by the Fathers, and paid by the Primitive Christians, came in here almost as soon as Christianity it self, and began first to be paid of Devotion in obedience to Gods Law, and then by Custom, and some humane Laws were confirmed, till at length, by a general Law and voluntary Donation of them throughout the whole Kingdom, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the King and Three Estates, they were for ever Dedicated to the Church, and have been confirmed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Acts of Parliament, and Canons almost in every
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:95318:109"/> Kings Reign since, with severe Penalties on the Offenders. And by virtue of these Laws the Clergy have enjoyed them for above 800 years, adding <hi>Prescription</hi> to all their other Titles; and ever since they have been a Collateral Estate, distinct from the Inheritance of the Land, so that no Purchasor could, or did ever buy them, nor no Inheritor could, or ever did sell them, or bequeath them to his Heir; nor can any but the Clergy by Law claim any Property in this sort of Tithes, and therefore no Possessor now can be said to give them out of his own, any more than he that pays an Ancient Free Rent, or Rent-charge, formerly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for ever to some Colledge or Hospital; for they are Gods part, and in his right legally setled on the Clergy, who do therefore now possess Tithes by as good a Title, as any Man in the Nation possesseth his own Inheritance, descending to him from his Ancestors; and this may suffice for this Chapter.</p>

IF the discourse of Lay Consecrations had imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately followed these Laws to the contrary, it would have appeared too incredible even for an easie Faith; and therefore to amuse the Reader, and divert his thoughts from these Constitutions, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> once more steps back into the Primitive Times, to enquire about the <hi>Original of Parishes,</hi> which disquisition doth not necessarily belong to the payment of Tithes, because we have proved, Tithes were paid in the Primitive Church, when the whole Bishopric was one great Parish as to the matter of Revenue,

Wherefore if the <hi>Britons</hi> had only such Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes among them, yet they might pay Tithes to their Bishop, to be by him distributed among the Clergy, as it was done of old in other parts of Christendom; and Mr. <hi>S.</hi> saith, <hi>It is not likely that in those times this Island should differ therein, from what was uniformly received through those parts of Christendom whereof we have best Testimony re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining</hi>

And if we consider <hi>France</hi> alone, the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Christian Country to the <hi>Britons,</hi> and that with which they most conversed, it will be evident from the Council of <hi>Mascon,</hi> that Tithes had been paid there long before, <hi>An.</hi> 586; yea it is plain from the Testament of S. <hi>Remigius, An.</hi> 470, that there were Parish Churches in <hi>France</hi> with Tithes belonging to them, called there <hi>Ecclesias cum decimis &amp; appenditiis</hi>

               <p n="2">§. II. For the Age of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> it cannot be expected that <hi>Augustine,</hi> when he came first to preach to Pagans, should require more than voluntary Oblations, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he and his Clergy for a while lived in common; but afterward King <hi>Ethelbert</hi> and he built and repaired many Churches<note n="(m)" place="margin">

And if there were no Country Churches then seperately endowed, but the whole Revenue of the Diocess was paid to the Bishop, whose Clergy lived with him on this Common stock, as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> affirms, how could this Country Church have any such Possession? and why did not <hi>Sexwulf</hi> retain this Reverend Confessor with him, and give him allowance out of the Common stock?

And Mr. <hi>S.</hi> hath no way to disprove this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and well attested Opinion, but by suggesting these great and Learned Writers did not understand the word <hi>Parochias,</hi> which being of old used for a Bishopric, he thinks, they fully applied it to denote the limits of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Church, and therefore he would have us believe, that since two new Bishops were made in the Province of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> in <hi>Honorius</hi> his time (where there were three Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprics before) therefore it was said, <hi>Honorius primus Provinciam suam in Parochias divisit;</hi> that is, He first divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it into Bishoprics. But how could the erecting two New Bishopricks, in two newly converted Countries, be called a dividing his whole Province into Bishoprics? or what probability is there, so many Learned Authors should be so grosly mistaken? they must have small Opinion of either their learning or diligence, who will quit their plain sense for so harsh a gloss as this of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> who indeed hath nothing against this Tradition, but meer guesses, and therefore we will (till better proof appear against it) take it for granted, <hi>That</hi> Honorius <hi>divided his Province into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes in the modern sense,</hi> An. 630.</p>

                     <hi>Beda</hi> hist. l. 3. c. 7. p. 99.</note>, (which was in <hi>Honorius</hi> his time) and therefore it is not likely that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes had their Original from Lay-foundations; and since Mr. <hi>S.</hi> grants, that the <hi>restraining such a Portion of the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:95318:111"/> Profits from the common Treasury of the Diocess, and annexing them to a Priest resident at a Country Church, was by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Bishop</hi> (who for the better edifying of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple willingly diminished his own income,) it follows from thence, that though Lay-men did build the Churches, yet Bishops set out the Parishes at the dedication<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bed.</hi> ib. l. 5. c. 4, &amp; 5.</note>; at which time, by the old Canons the endowment of the Church was to be setled by the Bishop, who though he might be guided in the assigning the limits of a New Parish by the extent of a Lay-founders Land, yet the Bishop made these limits: And least any Lay-men should pretend to do this without the Bishop, it was commanded afterward by a Canon, <hi>That the Bishop of the Diocess should alwaies consecrate New built Churches,</hi> An. 816<note n="(b)" place="margin">Concil. ap <hi>Spelm.</hi> T. 1. p. 330.</note>; and the same Synod in the 10th Canon declares, there were then divers Parish Churches in one Bishopric, and Priests ordinarily resident in them. And that there were Endowments long before setled on these Country Churches, appears by what is noted before, §. II. to which we may now add, that King <hi>Canutus</hi> saith, <hi>It was due by an ancient Law for Men to pay their</hi> Cyric-sceat <hi>to the Church in whose Parish they lived</hi>

                  <note n="(e)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 9. p. 264.</note>, being cited in the <hi>Statuta Synodorum,</hi> collected <hi>An.</hi> 900, must needs have been held long before that time; and if Parishes were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited so early in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be sure they were far elder in <hi>England,</hi> and if they had not been limited before <hi>An.</hi> 900, it had been impertinent in the Collector of <hi>Statuta Synodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> to have put it in for a Law here; wherefore it is strange Mr. <hi>S.</hi> (who confesses all this) should say, <hi>The first express limitation of Profits to be given to this or that Church, is in the Laws of King</hi> Edgar, <hi>An.</hi> 970. (related before <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. §. 9.) for the instance of <hi>Putta</hi>'s Country Church and others before shew the contrary; but these Laws of King <hi>Edgar</hi> do clearly declare, Profits were limited of a
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:95318:112"/> long time before; for in those Laws are three sort of Churches, first, <hi>The old Minster or Church, which was the Mother of the rest, to which it is there said, the right of Tith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing properly belongs.</hi> And this was the old Parish Church, built it is likely in the time of <hi>Honorius</hi> his first division of Parishes, whose Territory being very large, the Bishops and Lay-Owners (by their consent) erected some new Churches and Chappels within that precinct; and if the Bishop (who only could limit Profits) gave this Church right of Sepulture, then the Lord might (with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops allowance) give to this new Erection some part of his Tithe, formerly due to the Mother Church; but if it had no right of Sepulture, it remained to be a Chappel, and the Lord could not give any of the old Churches Tithes to it; but if he would have a Curate there, he must maintain him out of his own Nine parts, and pay his Tithe to the Mother Church beside. Which Law is so far from disproving the Antiquity of Parish Churches, with set Limits and certain Profits, that it shews Parochial right of Tithes was then so very firmly setled in the old Parish Church, and had been so long owned, that no new erected Church could deprive it of all its right, nor of any part of it, but by the Bishops consent. Which is also an evident proof, there could then be no Arbitrary Consecrations made by the Laity. 'Tis true, many of these new Churches which had right of Burial, afterward became Parish Churches, yet in many places still the right of the old Parish Church is preserved, as in my own Church, which receives two parts of the Tithe of divers Lands lying in another Parish (as it is now accounted;) and that Church, in whose Parish now the Land is reckoned to lie, hath but the third part of the Tithe; which shews, that my Church anciently was the <hi>Elder Minster,</hi> and this but a new Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by the Bishops consent: But for the Churches without right of Burial, they were and still are only Chappels, and this in after-times was reckoned the distinction between a <hi>Parochial Church</hi> and <hi>Chappel,</hi> that the one had right of Burial, and the other had not. As for the Original of some
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:95318:112"/> Parishes after the Conquest, it is rather an alteration of the old division of Parishes than any new Division; and since Mr. <hi>S.</hi> grants it was made by Ecclesiastical consent, that shews the Bishops first divided Parishes, his first instance is clear, <hi>viz.</hi> of a command from the Pope to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>York,</hi> to erect a New Parish within one that was too large<note n="(f)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 9. p. 267.</note>; and his second instance only shews, that the Bishops did desire the King to consent to the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting two Parishes together, but still the uniting these Churches (though done by the Kings Licence, who it is likely was Patron of the Church to be united to that Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Church) was the Bishops Act, as is most evident from a Patent of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, for such another U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion where the King gives License—<hi>ut ille ad quem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet, annectere &amp; unire posset</hi>
                  <note n="(g)" place="margin">Monast. Tom. 1. p. 493. &amp; pag 494.</note>; that is, that the Bishop may unite two Parishes. Wherefore by all this it is plain, both that the division of Parishes is very ancient, and that the Bishop always did limit them, and assign the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to them; and this may suffice for Parochial Limits.</p>

                     <hi>Malmsb.</hi> gest. reg. l. 1. p. 6.</note>, <hi>An.</hi> 686, is no proper proof of Heathens devotion in Tithing, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an evidence, that the Christian <hi>Saxons, An.</hi> 686, used to pay Tithes; for <hi>Cedwalla</hi> had conversed with Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and though he deferred his Baptism, yet he was well opinionated of the Christian Faith before he was baptized, as appears by <hi>Bedes</hi> relation, <hi>of his giving the Fourth part of the Isle of</hi> Wight, <hi>and also of the Spoils to</hi> Wilfrid <hi>the Bishop, as he had vowed before his Baptism</hi>

                     <hi>Bed.</hi> hist. l. 4. c. 16. p. 169.</note>. And (whatever Mr. <hi>S.</hi> pretends) there is no contradiction between <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> for <hi>Bede</hi> mentions his Vowing Spoils also, as well as the Fourth part of the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> while he is relating his War there; and <hi>Malmsbury</hi> is speaking of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther War against the <hi>Kentish</hi> Men, after which he tells us, <hi>That he Tithed to God all his Spoils of War:</hi> so that it is likely they may speak of two several things.

                  <hi>[to Consecrate]</hi> for the very same reason. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> pretends to give some other instances of the like use of the word <hi>Decima,</hi> for any <hi>Consecrated</hi> part, but they do not reach the point; for if Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Ninth do call King <hi>Athelstanes</hi> gift of four <hi>Threaves</hi> out of every plough Land in the East-riding, to S <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Beverley</hi> a Tithe, it is not unlikely it may be a full Tenth, for every Threave is 24 Sheaves, and four Threaves is nigh 100 Sheaves out of every Plough-land; but Authors differ so much about the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:95318:113"/> quantity of a Plough-land, that we cannot exactly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this matter. His next instance of <hi>Robert Hesel</hi> (who gave to the building of <hi>Giseburn</hi> Church <hi>duas Garbas,</hi> out of his Land of <hi>Hesel,</hi> which is also called a <hi>Tithing</hi>) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be explained of two Sheaves only, for that had not been worth fetching, nor would it have been considerable toward building a Church; and therefore it must signifie, <hi>Two Tithe Sheaves,</hi> the Third being usually reserved by the Bishop for the Parish Priest, before he would allow such gifts. Thus in the Parish of <hi>Hurst, Perpoint</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Lewis</hi> had two Tithe Sheaves, and the Priest of the Parish the Third: But however this word <hi>Decima</hi> be used, whether for the <hi>Tenth,</hi> or any other part <hi>consecrated,</hi> it makes nothing against the general usage of Tithing.</p>
               <p n="2">§. II. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> passeth by many unexceptionable proofs of Tithes paid in the times of the <hi>Britons</hi> and old <hi>Saxons,</hi> and produces a story of <hi>Augustines</hi> excommunicating the Lord of <hi>Cometon</hi> for not paying his Tithes, because there are some incredible circumstances in it; but though <hi>Jorval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensis</hi>

                  <note n="(n)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 10. p. 275.</note>. And he must think the old <hi>Saxons</hi> had but little devotion, if the Doctrine of the Fathers, the Example of other Western Churches, the Laws of the Kingdom, and equity of the thing it self, could not move them to give Tithes. The Epistle of <hi>Boniface, An.</hi> 750 (cited above) shews they ordinarily paid them, before Laws were made to compel them. And since the <hi>Britons</hi> learned from S. <hi>Germanus</hi> and <hi>Lupus</hi> to give Tithes, <hi>An.</hi> 470, it is no strange thing that Tithes should be paid in S. <hi>Cadoc</hi>'s time. As for the passage of <hi>Beda</hi> concerning <hi>Eadbert</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lindis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farn, An.</hi> 665, <hi>Who gave the Tenth of his Cattel, Fruit, and

                     <hi>Bed.</hi> hist. l. 4. c. 29.</note>, is an evidence that Tithe was then thought to be so due to God from all, that this devout Bishop (who being of the Clergy himself, could not pay them to the Clergy) paid them to the Poor; but not as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> suggests, <hi>according to the Law of Moses,</hi> for that Law never enjoyned any Man to give all his Tithes every year to the Poor; wherefore the meaning is, <hi>according to the Law of God,</hi> which was then believed to declare the <hi>Tenth</hi> to be Gods part, and where the Clergy could not be his Receivers, there he thought the Poor ought to be so: And this Opinion so prevailed by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this and other devout Clergy-men, that within an 150 years after, a Canon was made to enjoyn the Tenth part of every Bishops Estate at his decease to be given to the Poor.<note n="(p)" place="margin">Concil. <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyth.</hi> An. 816. <hi>Spelm.</hi> Tom. 1. pag. 330.</note>
               </p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his design were not to make the payment of Tithes seem late, arbitrary, and uncertain, how could he (after all his proofs and confessions of payment among the old <hi>Saxons</hi>) pretend that we can only <hi>conjecture there was some such practice from</hi> Canutus <hi>his Epistle, An.</hi> 1031<note n="(q)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 7. p. 277.</note>; whereas it is as certain as History can make any thing, that Tithes were generally paid long before, and <hi>Canutus</hi> there saith, <hi>Tithes are due by the ancient Law:</hi> And though the King do there threaten to execute the penalties on such as had not paid them fully at his return, that doth not suppose any general neglect, only it shews a great Opinion of their being due, and that he intended to terrifie all covetous and sacrilegious Persons from doing so great an act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice as the detaining of them was, in his opinion; so that it only proves there might be some ill Men in that Age, as there are in all others. As for that other complaint, which he thinks, is but a later Edition to King <hi>Edwards</hi> Laws, <hi>That some, after the first granting of Tithes, had by the instinct of the Devil detained them, and the Priests having large Parishes, and enough beside, were remiss in demanding them</hi>

This is no proof of general omission neither, for the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of some People, and the connivance of some depending Clergy Men in this Age of ours, though they be generally paid regularly, might give us occasion to say as much now.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:95318:114"/> As for the time before King <hi>Edward,</hi> there is sufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of general payment, and very strict Laws to enforce it; and in the <hi>Confessors</hi> time Tithes were so well paid, that the Charters after the Conquest made that the Rule for good payment: so <hi>Henry</hi> the First orders, <hi>That the Church of S.</hi> John <hi>of</hi> Beverly <hi>shall have its Tithes paid as fully as when it was best paid, in the days of King</hi> Edward, <hi>or of his Father</hi> William <hi>the Conqueror</hi>

               <p>But he tells us, <hi>However it might be in elder times, it was about the</hi> Norman <hi>Conquest much discontinued</hi>
                  <note n="(w)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 10. p. 279.</note>, which he would prove from <hi>Domus-Dei</hi> Book, where divers Churches are reckoned up with other Possessions, and yet but seldom are Tithes named among those Possessions. To which I answer, Since he hath granted Parochial right of Tithes to be fixed so long before, it is certain these Churches once had a right of Tithes, and there is no account in History when or how these Churches should lose this right again, nor any reason to believe, that since some Churches (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this Record) did retain this right, others should have lost it. And there is a clear reason, why in that Book some Churches have Tithes mentioned, and others not, <hi>viz.</hi> because the Inquest was made by divers Jurors, some of which left Tithes out, because they were free from all service to the King, and others thought fit however to put them in. But this Negative Argument, or rather Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, will quickly vanish, when we consider what full and express proof there is, that Tithes did belong to Churches in the Conquerors days, and were always conveyed with them. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> shews, that Parochial Tithes were sued for in this Kings time<note n="(x)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 14. p. 416.</note>, and that the payment of Tithes then, was made a Rule for good payment in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the First<note n="(y)" place="margin">Ib. p. 417.</note>. The Conquerors Charter to

The Chartulary of <hi>Rochester</hi> (commended by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> above all others) saith he gave to the Priory there <hi>Rother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, with all appertaining to it, in Tithes, &amp;c. the Church of</hi> Walton, <hi>with the Tithes of all pertaining to it.</hi> And King <hi>Henry</hi> the First doth in those <hi>Chartularies</hi> confirm divers Tithes to that Priory, commanding they shall be paid to them, as fully as they had been in the days of his Father: which are such plain evidence, that Tithes then were rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned to be due and appertaining to Churches, that if some of the Inquest did not return them, yet we may be assured they were among the possessions of all Churches in that Age. And if <hi>Ingulphus</hi> only mentions Churches given to <hi>Crowland</hi> Abby, and not <hi>Ecclesias cum Decimis</hi>

                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> ib. p. 282.</note>. For it is plain, the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was constant and universal; and though many things were put into confusion for a while at the Conquest, yet the Conqueror who had sworn to maintain the Churches right, did not at all offer to take away the established pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Parochial Tithes, if he had, the Clergy of that Age, some of which liberally publish his Crimes) had not concealed this notorious Sacriledge, of which there is not the least mention in any Author: and therefore Mr. <hi>S.</hi> wisely forbore to mention <hi>His gifts of Churches with Tithes
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95318:115"/> to the Priory of</hi> Rochester; (some of which we related before) for this would have discovered the vanity of his pretences, and shewed, that Churches and Tithes then always went together.</p>
               <p>In King <hi>Henry</hi> the Firsts time, out of innumerable proofs of regular payment, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> picks up some few that may seem to make it dubious: The Monks of <hi>Lindisfaru</hi> (he saith) desired of a Covetous Lord <hi>the Tithe of Fish, due to them by Law and the custom of the Province;</hi> which proves both a right and ancient practice, and though this evil Man would not do him justice, yet that is no proof of general Non-payment; and the Relator saith, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged this Impiety on him, which shews it was a crime not often committed, because it was punished by a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judgment. Those Persons who lived within the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes of Churches appropriate to Abbies, ought to pay their Tithes to those Abbies, and no others; and these were those whom the Chartulary of <hi>Abingdon</hi> complains of, That they did not pay their Tithes in kind, as it was enjoyned by Law, but in lieu thereof 40 Sheaves out of a Hide, or else the Tenth Acre of their Tillage; but we see this Practice was contrary to Law, and to the usual way of paying Tithe, and therefore it is complained of: for the Tithes of these Churches were Canonically conveyed to that Abby of <hi>Abingdon,</hi> as the Bull of Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> shews, <hi>An.</hi> 1146, which mentions and confirms divers Churches, <hi>which they justly and Caonnically possessed</hi>
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">Monastic. <hi>Angl.</hi> T. 1. pag. 107.</note>.</p>
               <p>In the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> produces a Decretal of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, which saith, <hi>Men were bound to pay the full Tenth part of their Fruits to that Church of which they were Parishioners, according to the general Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Church of</hi> England<note n="(e)" place="margin">Append. ad Concil. <hi>Later.</hi> par. 4. c. 4.</note>; and another Decree of the same Pope, directed (not only to the Diocess, but) to the whole Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> declares, <hi>That the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that Province were wont to pay their Tithes entirely, to those Churches to which they were due; but now neglecting this laudable Custom, some did detain some kind of Tithes</hi>
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">Decret. l. 3. Tit. 30. cap. 5. pag. 1327.</note>. And Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> Predecessor to <hi>Alexander,</hi> in the next

                  <note n="(h)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 10. p. 284.</note>. Finally, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> saith, there are other declarations of that kind in the <hi>Leiger</hi> Book of Reading: Yet though we see Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ancient Custom, general Institution of the Church, laudable Usage, and allowed Law, do all concur to prove regular payment of Tithes continued in this time. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> tells us, <hi>We must not conclude out of all these for Practice, viz.</hi> purely for this reason, because they cross his novel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Lay arbitrary Consecrations, which he is so far from justifying, by the Examples of the next Chapter, that we shall shew they are all falsified, and purposely mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to carry on an ill design.</p>
               <p>He proceeds to <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, where though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, the Tithes of Hay and Mills on the Kings demesns, were detained by some of his Bayliffs, <hi>An.</hi> 1227, which occasioned that Writ of the Kings to enjoyn these Tithes, should be fully paid for the future: yet it is plain, that Tithe Hay was regularly paid by others long before, for the Chartularies of <hi>Rochester</hi> mention a Sute between the Prior of <hi>Rochester</hi> and the Parson of <hi>Bocton Malherb, An.</hi> 1166, for Tithe Hay, which the Parson claimed in right of his Church, and the Prior by Prescription and Possession time out of mind. And there also <hi>William de Albeney</hi> (who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>An.</hi> 1136) is remembred to have given Tithe of his Mills at <hi>Elmham</hi> to the same Priory. Yea the Constitutions before mentioned, <hi>Chap.</hi> VIII. §. 24. made in this Kings Reign, do mention the Tithe of Mills and Hay among <hi>(Decimas consuetas)</hi> Tithes that were usually paid. As for the Times after this King, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> grants there are certain proofs of Parochial right of Tithes, claimed <hi>De jure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni,</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:95318:116"/> and that before the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the First, the Parson need make no other proof of his right to Tithes, but to prove they lay in his Parish; of which he saith, <hi>there are frequent Examples in the Year Books,</hi> pag. 285. But out of them all he produces not one, because they establish Parochial payment, choosing rather to divert his Reader with an impertinent story of the Parsons and Vicars of <hi>Cornwal</hi> paying Tithes of the Stannaries there, though (for ought appears) they had recovered them of the King, if it had been proved they had been usually paid to the Bishop of <hi>Exeter.</hi> After this Mr. <hi>S.</hi> goes on to the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, (though he grants Parochial right established long before) and for want of other matter he relates the Rhithms of Satyrical Poets, who in all Ages use to reflect upon Men of any Profession in power and esteem; but I suppose he doth not take these Mens fancies for true Characters, if he did, we might remember what <hi>Chaucer</hi> saith of the Men of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Profession: but this is to leave the Subject.</p>
               <p>The Custom of paying <hi>Mortuaries,</hi> in satisfaction for omission of Tithes, is much ancienter than <hi>Edward</hi> the Thirds time<note n="(i)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 10. p. 287.</note>, there being a Constitution for paying them made by <hi>Stephen Langton,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury, An.</hi> 1206, mentioning a former Constitution of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor about the same thing<note n="(k)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Spelm.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. T. 2. p. 133.</note>, and another of <hi>Richard</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham, An.</hi> 1276<note n="(l)" place="margin">Ib. p. 318.</note>. But as well this paying of Mortuaries, as all before remembred, do abundantly shew, Parochial right was received and acknowledged from ancient times, and though Mr. <hi>S.</hi> hath made so many vain attempts to make it seem of later Original, yet at last he confesses, <hi>It is not clearly known when it came first to be setled in Practice</hi>
                  <note n="(m)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 10. p. 288.</note>. I answer, It must needs begin as soon as Parishes were set out, and Profits limited, which he hath granted, and I have proved was in the times of the Old <hi>Saxons,</hi> and therefore it is strange he should here doubt, whether it were customary in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seconds time, or produce that idle story of his mistaken Monks, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it began to be setled first in the Council of <hi>Lyons,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:95318:117"/> An.</hi> 1274. (a Council which saith not one word of this matter.) Is it not certain, by what Mr. <hi>S.</hi> and my self have cited, <hi>Chap.</hi> VIII. that this Right was setled not only before <hi>Edward</hi> the Firsts time, but long before the Conquest by Synodal and Secular Laws too? How then could it be found never setled till <hi>An.</hi> 1200? or what evidence is there of any discontinuance before that time? The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Instances shew there was no such matter, nor can it be collected from the illegal and condemned practice of some Persons in one Diocess (which is all that is implied in <hi>Innocents</hi> Decretal, cited before <hi>Chap.</hi> VIII. §. 23.) that there was any general discontinuance, since <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third saith (not 20 years before) <hi>That the Men of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince were wont to pay their Tithes fully to the Churches to which they were due,</hi> (as was shewed just now;) and if <hi>Many in that</hi> (not Province, as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> falsly reports, but) <hi>Diocess did presume arbitrarily to distribute their Tithes, in</hi> Innocents <hi>time,</hi> the practice was presently declared unreasonable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just and illegal, and was immediately reformed, and so doth not prove any general omission of paying Parochial Tithes. And the next Chapter will shew, there was no such usual arbitrary Conveyances of Tithes to Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by Lay-men as he pretends, either used in fact or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Civil, much less by Canon Law; for the Laws al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways required the Bishops consent to these Lay-grants, and in Fact, the Lay Grantors ever had their Grants confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by such consent in all times, as I shall prove by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand instances. Now though the Bishops did ill to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to such Grants, yet since the Original right of distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting Parishes and Parochial Tithes was believed to be in them, this Consent both shews the Lay-mens Grants were not arbitrary, nor Parochial right overthrown by such like dispositions of Tithes. As for <hi>Wicklief,</hi> he is as much mistaken in his Chronology as he is in his Opinion; and though Mr. <hi>S.</hi> would help him out, by explaining <hi>within few years,</hi> to be <hi>within</hi> 200 <hi>years;</hi> yet all this will not shake the foundation of Parochial Tithes, or make any consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man think they began so late as the year 1200. But
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:95318:117"/> he cites some passages out of the Year Books, to prove, <hi>That before the Council of</hi> Lateran, <hi>every man might give his Tithes to what Church he pleased</hi>
                  <note n="(n)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 10. p. 292.</note>; which if it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that they might do it with the Bishops consent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Council, and not afterwards, since the Bishops were there forbid to consent: in this sense it is true; but in Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his sense it is notoriously untrue: and Mr. <hi>S.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, <hi>pag.</hi> 359, <hi>That these passages in the Year Books have been taken for falshoods, grounded upon ignorance;</hi> and so they really are, if they mean the Laity might do this without the Bishops consent, though I am apt to believe, both the Monks, and the old Lawyers did mean it of a power to give their Tithes to Monasteries by Episcopal consent, and then their Assertions may be reconciled to sense and truth. But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> who strains these expressions to Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power of disposing Tithes by Lay-men, blunders extreamly to bring them off, confessing no Canon of any <hi>Lateran</hi> Council of that time, did alter the Law in that particular, and then conjectures it was but a private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal Epistle, signed in the <hi>Lateran,</hi> only relating to the Diocess of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which they took for the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council; but all this while he supposes his Monks and Lawyers to be notably skilful, who could not distinguish between <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Lateran,</hi> nor between <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> nor between a private Decretal and a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil: So that we may perceive it was his excess of affection to his New device of arbitrary Lay Consecrations, that runs him upon all these false and mistaken conjectures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the original of Parochial payment of Tithes; but unless his following Instances were better proof, he might have saved the labour of making these two Chapters to undermine Parochial right, and introduce them with some apparance of Probability: For neither do these Arguments, nor those Instances, shake the ancient usual and universal custom of paying Tithes parochially, where the Bishop did not agree to some other disposal of them.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">§. I. THE great strength for Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his proofs of <hi>Lay Consecrations,</hi> lies in the many Instruments yet remaining in the Chartularies of the old Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, which he hath here collected, as undeniable evidence that Lay-men, from the year 1000 till after the year 1200, did at their own pleasure (without requiring the Bishops consent) consecrate their Tithes, or any part of them, to Monasteries; which Donations were made, as he pretends, only by these Charters he produces, and allowed by the practiced Law of that time, and that if there were any Confirmations of Bishops added to the Lay-Donors Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they were procured by the Monks afterwards to satisfie the Canons. But all this is so contrary to truth, and to the practice of that Age, that though I have no other help than what I receive, from the Chartularies of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> (transcribed by Doctor <hi>Tildesly,</hi> formerly Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon there) from the <hi>Monasticon Anglicanum,</hi> and from Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his own Instruments here cited; yet I doubt not to shew, that the Bishops Consent was required to make the Lay-mans Grant valid from the beginning, yea that the very Bishops Charters originally allowing these Lay-Grants are extant, even in Sir <hi>Robert Cottons</hi> Library, out of which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> quotes these Instruments, so that it was impossible for him to find the Lay Grant, but he must at the same time see the Bishops Charter; yet he conceals the Bishops Charter most disingeniouly, and fraudulently transcribes the Lay Charter, as if it were arbitrary, and made without any Bishops consent at all. And besides, he
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:95318:118"/> often cites later Confirmations of the Lay granters Heirs, as if they were Original Grants, and pretends these to be Arbitrary Consecrations, when the <hi>Tithes</hi> mentioned in them were confirmed by Bishops long before; indeed this whole Chapter is so full of designed mistakes, and fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent dealing, that it is enough to shew how little he can be trusted in matter of fact, who to serve an evil end, and support a false Opinion of his own, values not how falsly he represents the matter. But because his Instances are thrown into a confused heap, I shall render the practice of the time more intelligible, and more orderly and briefly confute all his Instances, by reducing them under those several evidences of Ecclesiastical consent, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his pretended Arbitrary Consecrations.</p>
               <p>First, The ancientest way of declaring the Bishops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent was, by their signing and sealing the Original Charter; which practice was used in the old <hi>Saxon</hi> Times before the Conquest, where we find no Charters made to any Abbies, but still the Bishops do sign and seal them; and though the <hi>Saxons</hi> usually gave only Land, and rarely any Tithes to their Abbies (the first gift of Tithes to the Abby of S. <hi>Augustines, Canterbury,</hi> being one of <hi>William</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror<note n="(o)" place="margin">Chron. <hi>w. Thorn.</hi> A. 1070.</note>) yet still their Bishops consents were desired to confirm it, and therefore they subscribe all Lay Grants with these words, <hi>Confirmavi, Corroboravi, Assensum dedi, &amp;c.</hi> so in the Chartularies of <hi>Abingdon,</hi> Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and <hi>Rethun</hi> a Bishop, consent to <hi>Kenulphs</hi>'s Donation, <hi>An.</hi> 821<note n="(p)" place="margin">Monast. <hi>Angl.</hi> Tom. 1. p. 100.</note>.

                  <note n="(r)" place="margin">Ib. Vide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam Monast. <hi>Angl.</hi> T. 1. p. 13.</note>: So the Charter of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor to S. <hi>Benets</hi> in <hi>Hulmo,</hi> is confirmed and allowed by six Bishops<note n="(s)" place="margin">Ib. p. 284.</note>. And when <hi>Osrich,</hi> a Nobleman, founded the Abby of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> by Licence from King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> An. 690, <hi>Theodore</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Bosel</hi> first Bishop of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> confirm it<note n="(t)" place="margin">Ib. p. 108.</note>. The same method of declaring Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical consent by the Bishops signing the Original Grant, was used both in <hi>Ireland</hi>
                  <note n="(u)" place="margin">Mon. <hi>Angl.</hi> T. 2. de <hi>Coenob. Hibern.</hi> p. 1027. 1031, 1032, 1035.</note>, and also in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:95318:119"/> And so it was in <hi>Normandy</hi> before our Conquest, for when <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> founded the Abby of S. <hi>Vigours,</hi> and endowed it with Tithes, <hi>An.</hi> 1032, six Bishops seal the Grant and corroborate it<note n="(x)" place="margin">Ib. <hi>Caenob. Gallic.</hi> p. 958.</note>; and accordingly after our Conquest the <hi>Norman</hi> Bishops still signed to all the Kings Grants to Monasteries there until the times of <hi>Henry</hi> the First<note n="(y)" place="margin">Ib. p 958, &amp; 961.</note>, yea of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second<note n="(z)" place="margin">Ib. p. 978.</note>. Hence it came to be also the Custom in <hi>England</hi> in the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors time, for the Bishops to witness the Donors Charter, and so to express their consent: So the Conquerors Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Battel</hi> Abby, in which he gives three Churches with Tithes, is signed by Two Archbishops and four Bishops<note n="(a)" place="margin">Monast. <hi>Angl.</hi> Tom. 1. p. 317.</note>; and King <hi>William Rufus</hi> expresly declares, he had the Bishops consent, who are also named as confirming his Grant<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ib. p. 318.</note>. King <hi>Stephen</hi> also made his Donation to <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow</hi> Priory by the Consent of his Bishops, who confirmed it<note n="(c)" place="margin">Monast. <hi>Angl.</hi> Tom. 1. p. 526, 358.</note>. Such Examples of Bishops signing, and so decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their consent to the Kings Charters, are frequent in the <hi>Monasticon,</hi> in the Reigns of King <hi>Henry</hi> the First<note n="(d)" place="margin">Ib p. 681.</note>, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second<note n="(e)" place="margin">Ibid p. 360, 366, 390.</note>, K. <hi>Richard</hi> the First<note n="(f)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 558.</note>, and King <hi>John</hi>
                  <note n="(g)" place="margin">Ib. p. 478.</note>. And in many of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Instances, which he brings in as Lay-mens Arbitrary Grants without Episcopal consent, the Bishops are Witnesses to the Instrument: so here <hi>pag.</hi> 300. he cites a Charter of <hi>Henry</hi> the First, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Grants of <hi>Alberic de Vere</hi> to <hi>Colm</hi> a Cell of <hi>Abingdon, An.</hi> 1111, as if it were made without any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops consent, whereas the very Charter is extant at large in the <hi>Monasticon,</hi> and is witnessed by two Bishops, yea and the Preface introducing it (cited out of Sir <hi>Robert Cottons</hi> Library) saith, <hi>Alberic de Vere got it confirmed by the Authority of the King and the Bishop</hi> Mauritius, <hi>in whose Diocess it was</hi>
                  <note n="(h)" place="margin">Monastic. <hi>Angl.</hi> Tom. 1. pag 437.</note>; but this Mr. <hi>S.</hi> most unworthily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals. So again, <hi>pag.</hi> 310. he pretends, <hi>Henry</hi> the First ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily gave the half Tithe of <hi>Tarentford,</hi> and of <hi>Whales</hi> catched in the Diocess of <hi>Rochester</hi> to the Priory there; but King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Charter is extant in the <hi>Monasticon,</hi> and is directed to Archbishop <hi>Anselm,</hi> and signed by Two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops<note n="(i)" place="margin">Mon. <hi>Angl.</hi> Tom. 1. p. 30.</note>; so that it is certain it was not without Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:95318:119"/> consent. And <hi>pag.</hi> 311. <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Albeny</hi>'s Grant of <hi>Elham</hi> and <hi>Bilsintune,</hi> is confirmed by King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter directed to <hi>Anselm,</hi> in whose Diocess they lay, and sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Roger</hi> a Bishop and Chancellor<note n="(k)" place="margin">Ib. p. 30.</note>, which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> also conceals. The gift of <hi>Geoffry</hi> E. of <hi>Essex</hi> to the Nuns of <hi>Clerkenwell</hi> (produced by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> for an arbitrary Lay-grant, <hi>pag.</hi> 319) is extant in the <hi>Monasticon,</hi> signed by three Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops <hi>(l);</hi>

The Charter of <hi>Mannasses Arsick</hi> is confirmed by King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Charter, to which the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> is the first Witness<note n="(p)" place="margin">Ib. p. 574.</note>. But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> takes no notice of all this, yet it utterly overthrows his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of arbitrary Lay Consecrations, because we see that ordinary Lay-mens Grants were confirmed both by the King and Bishop, and that the King himself gave not Tithes, unless the Bishops declared their assent at least by sealing and signing to his Charter: And we may be sure, the Bishops would not witness an Arbitrary Lay Grant, so contrary to the Canons, if their Consent were not first had thereto. I note also, that this Custom of the Bishops witnessing the Lay Grants, is a good reason why it is rare to meet with any special Charters of Bishops confirming Tithes granted to Abbies, especially before the year 1100: and now, if any shall think to excuse Mr. <hi>S.</hi> by saying, he did not know of this custom of the Bishops witnessing the Lay-grants, I can prove out of his own Examples that he did, for <hi>pag.</hi> 339 he produces a Charter of <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Warren,</hi> signed by the Archbishop and three Bishops more. And <hi>pag.</hi> 346. King <hi>Stephens</hi> Charter to the Priory of <hi>Eye,</hi> is signed by the King, Queen, Prince and Ten Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops (and no other) who also add an <hi>Anathema</hi> to their subscription, shewing they were parties to the Confirmation:
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:95318:120"/> so that he purposely concealed this Evidence of the Bishops consent in many of his Instances, on purpose to make them seem Arbitrary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There are yet extant very many Charters of Bishops, which both granted and confirmed such Tithes as were given to Abbies by Lay-men, all within the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>An.</hi> 1000 and a little after <hi>An.</hi> 1200, in which space Mr. <hi>S.</hi> pretends the Lay-granters never required any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops confirmation; a Catalogue of such Charters we will here set down out of the <hi>Monasticon,</hi> after we have first shewed, that divers such Original Charters are yet extant, which were made to confirm those very portions of Tithes, which he most unjustly produces here as Arbitrary Lay-grants. Among such Grants to the Priory of <hi>Rochester,</hi> he reckons Tithes of <hi>Strodes</hi> and <hi>Chealks,</hi> pag. 310. <hi>Bertrcy,</hi> pag. 313. <hi>Henhurst,</hi> pag. 314. <hi>Westbroc,</hi> pag. 315. <hi>Edintune,</hi> p. 316. <hi>Rundal</hi> and <hi>Tuang,</hi> p 317. and quotes the Chartu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries of <hi>Rochester</hi> for it, whereas in those very Chartularies there is a large and full Charter of <hi>Gundulphus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> from <hi>An.</hi> 1077 till <hi>An.</hi> 1107, which actually grants the Monks all these Tithes lying in his Diocess, and confirms the Lay-mens giving them, which, because it shews the use of the time nigh the Conquest, and totally confutes Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his pretences, I will here cite at large, Gundulphus, <hi>Bishop of</hi> Rochester, &amp;c.—<hi>perceiving the Christian Charity of our Sovereign King</hi> Henry, <hi>and some of his Nobles, to the Monks of S.</hi> Andrew—<hi>We do approve and ratifie their devotion to these Monks, and give Episcopal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and consent thereto, conferring on them, and granting to them the Tithes which are in the Parishes of divers Churches within our Diocess,</hi> viz. <hi>the Tithe of</hi> Strodes <hi>and</hi> Chealks <hi>in the Kings demesn, and by his liberality—the Tithes of</hi> Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurst — Rundal <hi>and</hi> Thuang—Bertrey —Edintunc, Westbroc, <hi>&amp;c. (reckoning up the Lay-donors of each parcel) And I will and command, that these Monks have and retain these Tithes arising out of the Mannors in our Diocess, and by my Episcopal Authority I assign them unto them, commanding and ordaining, that they shall have them for supply of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:95318:120"/> for ever.</hi> This Charter Mr. <hi>S.</hi> must needs see, if he read over the Chartularies of <hi>Rochester;</hi> and we may judge of his integrity, in that he not only passeth it by in silence, but brings these Tithes by name as arbitrary Lay Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without Episcopal consent. So also the gifts of Tithes to the same Monks in <hi>Bilsintune</hi> and <hi>Elham,</hi> pag. 311, <hi>Bugley</hi> and <hi>Gedding,</hi> pag. 312. <hi>Stalefield,</hi> pag. 313, <hi>Hain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wold, Schrombroch,</hi> and <hi>Dodindale,</hi> pag. 316. and in <hi>Ysfield,</hi> pag. 317. are produced by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> as other instances of such Consecrations; whereas all these being under the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> are in the same Chartularies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the particular Charters of those who were Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops at the time of these several Grants, which Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are still extant there, and this Record beside, <hi>The Tithes belonging to the Jurisdiction of</hi> Canterbury; <hi>Bilsintune, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> (and all the particulars aforementioned) <hi>are Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically collated and confirmed by our Venerable Fathers, the Archbishops of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>Anselm,</hi> (Consecrated <hi>An.</hi> 1093) <hi>William, Theobald, Richard, Baldwin</hi> and <hi>Hubert, as by their Authentic Instruments doth appear</hi>
                  <note n="(q)" place="margin">Chart. <hi>Rof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fens.</hi> p. 215.</note>. But Mr. <hi>S. pag.</hi> 318. fraudulently passing by the elder Confirmations of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selm, William,</hi> and <hi>Theobald,</hi> (which are as ancient as the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Grants of these Tithes) tells us, these Tithes were afterwards confirmed to them by the Archbishops of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> citing the Confirmation of <hi>Richard, An.</hi> 1176. and also of <hi>Baldwin</hi> and <hi>Hubert</hi> afterwards, as if these had been the first Confirmations, whereas these Tithes were some of them setled on them by the Archbishops consent above 80 years before. <hi>Pag.</hi> 315. It is not certain when <hi>Henry de Malmeins</hi> made that Grant of Tithes, cited by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> but it is confirmed in the Chartularies of <hi>Rochester</hi> by <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> who was Bishop there <hi>An.</hi> 1147, that is, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility as soon as the Gift; but not a word of this in Mr. <hi>S.</hi> nor of those other Confirmations of this <hi>Walter,</hi> and of <hi>Gilbert,</hi> both Bishops there before <hi>An.</hi> 1200, whose Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are yet extant, setling Tithes on these Monks by the words of <hi>Damus &amp; Concedimus;</hi> and so are the Bulls of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> also extant there, both which
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:95318:121"/> were Popes before <hi>An.</hi> 1200. <hi>Pag.</hi> 319. He brings in the gift of Tithes of <hi>Hamenesc</hi> by <hi>Walter Clifford,</hi> about King <hi>Johns</hi> time, <hi>An.</hi> 1200, and of <hi>Risebury</hi> by <hi>Robert Malherb</hi> to <hi>Leonminstre,</hi> as Original arbitrary Lay Consecrations; but there is a Charter of <hi>Richard</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hereford</hi> yet extant in the <hi>Monasticon</hi>
                  <note n="(r)" place="margin">Mon. <hi>Angl.</hi> Tom. 1. p. 420.</note>, which declares, <hi>That he had granted with his own hand, and confirmed to</hi> Redding, <hi>the Church of</hi> Leonminstre <hi>with all the Parishes pertaining to it, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly he names these two</hi> Hamenesc <hi>and</hi> Risebury, and this was <hi>An.</hi> 1123. <hi>viz.</hi> nigh 80 years before the confirmation of <hi>Walter Clifford,</hi> which though he cites here as an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Consecration, is no more but a confirmation of what his Ancestors had presented to the Bishop to settle on that Church many years before. <hi>Pag.</hi> 330.

               <p>Thirdly, But though the Original Bishops Charters granting divers of these Tithes mentioned by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> at the very first donation of the Lay Founders, be now perished by length of time, yet we may be assured there was such Charters by these following undeniable proofs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because it is recorded, that the Bishops (who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally were taken out of Monasteries, and so were great Friends to the Monks) did advise and perswade the Lay Donors to make Grants of Tithes to Abbies. So <hi>Pag.</hi> 306. the Charter of <hi>Robert d'Oiley</hi> (out of which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> reckons up those gifts of Tithes to the Abby of <hi>Osney,</hi> as arbitrary Lay Consecrations) saith expresly, <hi>That he founded this very Abby, Consulente &amp; confirmante</hi> Alexandro <hi>Dei gratiâ</hi> Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colniensi <hi>Episcopo</hi>
                  <note n="(w)" place="margin">Mon. <hi>Angl.</hi> Tom. 2. p. 137:</note>; so that it is plain he advised <hi>Robert d'Oily</hi> to found it, and confirmed the endowment at first, though his Charter be not now extant. And the <hi>Monasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> cites another old Record saying, <hi>Robert d'Oily founded this Church by the approbation of</hi> Theobald <hi>Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>and</hi> Alexander <hi>Bishop of</hi> Lincoln<note n="(x)" place="margin">Monast. ib.</note>. Also that other Charter of the same <hi>Robert d'Oily</hi> (cited by Mr. <hi>S. pag.</hi> 307) expresly saith, <hi>The Bishop of</hi> Lincoln <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised and confirmed it, and</hi> Theobald <hi>Archbishop of</hi> Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, <hi>is the first Witness to it</hi>
                  <note n="(y)" place="margin">Monast. ib. pag. 138.</note>; yet this he falsly produces for an arbitrary Lay Consecration, and basely concealing these old Testimonies of the Bishops consent to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Founders Grant (which he must needs see, while he transcribed so much of the Charter;) he tells us, this was confirmed long after by <hi>Richard</hi> (it should be <hi>Robert Grosthead</hi>) Bishop of <hi>Lincoln, An.</hi> 1250, as if this had been the first Episcopal confirmation, whereas 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he knew it was confirmed by his Predecessor from the first foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> 120 year before, what credit can be given to such a Historian? <hi>Pag.</hi> 325. The Tithes belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Tinemouth,</hi> confirmed by <hi>Henry</hi> the First to S. <hi>Albons,</hi> were given before to that Abby by <hi>Roger de Mowbray, By the leave of the King and the Archbishop</hi> Lanfranc (saith M. <hi>Paris</hi> in the place cited by Mr. <hi>S.</hi>
                  <note n="(z)" place="margin">

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:95318:123"/> The first founder and endower of the Abby of <hi>Lewis</hi> was <hi>William,</hi> the first Earl of <hi>Warren,</hi> whose Charter yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant declares, he did it <hi>by the advice of</hi> Lanfranc <hi>the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,</hi> and this Charter is signed both by the King and his Bishops in a Council at <hi>Winchester</hi>

Now if they desired, advised, and ordered the Patrons to make these Grants, what que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion can there be, but they confirmed them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Even where the Original Charters are lost, there is clear Evidence yet extant, that the Lay-granters had the consent of the Bishops, and did assign them by their Authority: So the Charter of <hi>Alberic de Vere;</hi> in Mr. <hi>S. pag.</hi> 300. concerning the sounding of <hi>Colm</hi> a Cell of <hi>Abingdon,</hi> is recorded to have been confirmed by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the King, and of the Bishop of the Diocess, <hi>Mauricius</hi>

I hope it is now very evident, that Lay-Patrons desired and procured them, and whether the first Charters be now extant or no, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly there were such Charters obtained to all these Grants.</p>
               <p>Wherefore as to the rest of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Instances, we shall only make some brief remarks on them and so dismiss them. And, <hi>First,</hi> divers of these which he calls arbitrary Lay Consecrations were granted by Charters directed <hi>To the Archbishops and Bishops,</hi> or elso <hi>to the Bishop of the Diocess;</hi> and that intimates, that the Bishop was to confirm this Charter afterward. So <hi>pag.</hi> 309. the Tithes of <hi>Lyum</hi> are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Gisburn</hi> Priory by a Charter of <hi>Robert Brus,</hi> the Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, directed <hi>To the King of</hi> England, <hi>and the Archbishop of York</hi>
                  <note n="(r)" place="margin">Monastic. Tom. 2 p. 147.</note>, because both the King and Bishop were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Grant. <hi>Pag.</hi> 310. The half Tithe of <hi>Tarentford</hi> is granted to the Monks of <hi>Rochester,</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Charter, directed to <hi>Anselm</hi> the Archbishop, and signed by two Bishops<note n="(s)" place="margin">T. 1. p. 30.</note>. The same Kings confirmation of <hi>Eltham</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:95318:127"/> and <hi>Bilsintun</hi> (mentioned in Mr. <hi>S. pag.</hi> 311) is directed to <hi>Anselm</hi> also, and attested by a Bishop<note n="(t)" place="margin">Ibid.</note>. <hi>Pag.</hi> 319. <hi>Geoffry</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> his Charter to the Nuns of <hi>Clerkenwell</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Archbishops, and signed by three Bishops<note n="(u)" place="margin">Ib. p. 433.</note>. <hi>Pag.</hi> 345. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> himself produces a Charter of <hi>Geoffry Fitz-Robert,</hi> granting Tithes to <hi>Ipswich (An.</hi> 1152) which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected <hi>To</hi> William <hi>Bishop of Norwich,</hi> who no doubt was to confirm it. <hi>Pag.</hi> 352. <hi>Henry</hi> the First's confirmation of Tithes to the Priory of <hi>Mountague,</hi> is directed <hi>To</hi> John <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of the Diocess</hi>
                  <note n="(w)" place="margin">Ib. p. 668.</note>; and <hi>Henry</hi> the Second confirms the same, by a Charter directed to the Archbishops, and signed by four Bishops<note n="(x)" place="margin">Ibid.</note>: But of this, Instances are so very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it is needless to be particular<note n="(y)" place="margin">Ib. p. 142, 354, 380, &amp;c.</note>; yet this shews, that the Consecration of Tithes were not arbitrary, for if so, why should the Gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts be directed to the Bishop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some other of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Instances of Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Consecrations are the Acts of Bishops, who no doubt acted agreeable to the Canons, and so if they were not Bishops of the Diocess themselves, had undoubtedly the Diocesans consent. So <hi>pag.</hi> 310. there is a grant of <hi>Ralph</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury (An.</hi> 1114) among his arbitrary Consecrations; but indeed it is a Confirmation of Tithes given by others in his Diocess. <hi>Pag.</hi> 316. The Tithes of <hi>Wickham</hi> were first given by <hi>Gundulphus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> whose Fee that Town was, and when he granted the Land to <hi>Godfry de Talbot,</hi> he reserved the Tithes to the Monks of <hi>Rochester;</hi> from <hi>Talbot</hi> the Land came to <hi>Columbers,</hi> who (upon a Suit between the Parson of <hi>Frendesbury</hi> and the Abbot) only declares what he found in his Deeds (as the Chartularies of <hi>Rochester</hi> shew,) yet Mr. <hi>S.</hi> hath the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to produce this as an arbitrary Lay Consecration. <hi>Pag.</hi> 321. The gift of <hi>Odo,</hi> who was Bishop of <hi>Bayeux;</hi> and <hi>p.</hi> 337. that of <hi>Ael</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> were undoubtedly Canonical Grants, and so ought not to be produced by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> among arbitrary Lay Consecrations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There are others of his Examples, which he produces as if they were Original Consecrations of Tithes, when indeed they are only the Confirmations of the Lay-donors
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:95318:127"/> Heirs, obtained by the Monks after long possession of Tithes, confirmed to them by Ecclesiastical consent many years before, some of which we have already taken notice of; and such is the Tithe of <hi>Tarentford,</hi> pag. 310, confirmed by King <hi>William Rusus</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Monast. Tom. 1. p. 29.</note>, yet produced by him, as if <hi>Henry</hi> the First originally confirmed it. So <hi>pag.</hi> 316. the Tithes of <hi>Wickham</hi> Canonically given by <hi>Gundul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> are by him produced as a Lay Consecration of <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Pag.</hi> 319. <hi>Walter de Clifford</hi>'s confirmation of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensec, &amp;c.</hi> An. 1200, was given long before, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Bishop of <hi>Hereford</hi> at least 70 years before<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ib. p. 420.</note>. <hi>Pag.</hi> 324. The Abbot of S. <hi>Albans</hi> gift of <hi>Caysho</hi> and <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> Tithes, <hi>An.</hi> 1235. was no other but a grant of Tithes, confirmed to them by Pope <hi>Honorius, An.</hi> 1218; which Bull of <hi>Honorius</hi> mentions Eight preceding Popes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming their Possessions to them, and the first was <hi>Calixtus, An.</hi> 1120<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ib. p. 59, 60.</note>: so that these Tithes were setled in the Abby above an hundred years before. <hi>Pag.</hi> 325. The Tithes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Tinemouth,</hi> were given to S. <hi>Albans</hi> by <hi>Roger de Mowbray,</hi> by the leave of the King and Archbishop <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franc,</hi> as <hi>Math. Paris</hi> shews<note n="(d)" place="margin">Vit. <hi>Pauli</hi> Abbatis, p. 51.</note>, and were confirmed by a Charter of King <hi>Williams,</hi> directed to the Archbishop, and to the Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi>
                  <note n="(e)" place="margin">Monast. Tom. 1. p. 334.</note>, long before King <hi>Henry</hi> came to the Crown; whose Confirmation of this old Grant, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Ecclesiastical consent before, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> produces for an Arbitrary Consecration. Other such like wilful mistakes are those Confirmations of S. <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Boxgrave, Seld.</hi> p. 330. That of <hi>Muchegrosse</hi> to <hi>Persore</hi> Abby, <hi>pag.</hi> 344. and of King <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror to <hi>Westminster,</hi> p. 351.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Others of his Examples are too late in time, and were made long after the year 1200, and so could not be Arbitrary Consecrations, because he grants Parochial Right was then so firmly setled, that the Laity (by his own confession) could not so dispose of their Tithes. Under this Head we may reckon the Grants of <hi>Peter de Brus</hi> to <hi>Gisburne,</hi> An. 1239, 1242, 1246<note n="(f)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 11. p. 309.</note>. That of <hi>Maud de Mandevil</hi> Countess of <hi>Essex,</hi> to <hi>Clerkenwell</hi>
                  <note n="(g)" place="margin">Ib. p. 320.</note>; for she was not Countess of <hi>Essex,</hi> till <hi>An.</hi> 1227. That of the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:95318:128"/> Abbot of S. <hi>Albans, An.</hi> 1235<note n="(h)" place="margin">Ib. p. 324.</note>, and that of the Prior of <hi>Lewes, An.</hi> 1260<note n="(i)" place="margin">Ib. p. 344.</note>; the custom of the Time acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> shews all these were impertinently alledged here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly;</hi> Many of his Instances are not concerning Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Tithes, as that of <hi>Geoffry</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> is a Grant of the Tithe of Meat used at his Table<note n="(k)" place="margin">Ib. p. 320.</note>. That of <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Warren,</hi> is of the Tenth penny of his Rents in Mony; and it was for detaining of this that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop blames his Widow<note n="(l)" place="margin">Ib. p. 342.</note>. So also the Tithes of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nison</hi> may be reckoned an extraordinary Tithe<note n="(m)" place="margin">Ib. p. 352.</note>, as well as that of <hi>Whales</hi>
                  <note n="(n)" place="margin">Ib. p 310.</note>; yet most of these Grants were by Ecclesiastical consent, as is shewed before. And for all those Grants of Abbots and Covents (which did dispose of Tithes sometimes, anciently setled on them by Bishops Charters and the Popes Bulls) they cannot be reckoned Lay Consecrations; and besides they were not arbitrary, for his own Historian, <hi>Thorn,</hi> who writes the History of S. <hi>Augustines Canterbury,</hi> assures us, That the Abbots there use to have the confirmation of the Archbishops, even to these dispositions of their own Tithes<note n="(o)" place="margin">Chron. <hi>W. Thorn.</hi> col. 1779 &amp; 1828.</note>. And he brings divers of these Abbots Leases of Tithes setled Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically on their Abbies, among his Arbitrary Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<note n="(p)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> p. 322, 323.</note>; and that which he falsly calls a grant of Tithes from <hi>Alexander</hi> Prior of <hi>Stanesgate</hi> to <hi>Clerkenwell</hi>
                  <note n="(q)" place="margin">Ib. p. 319.</note>, is a plain Lease of Tithes under the yearly Rent of Ten shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, as the Deed yet extant shews<note n="(r)" place="margin">Monastic. Tom. 1. p. 623.</note>. So that I hope now I may conclude, that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> hath brought no sufficient proof of any common use of Arbitrary Lay Consecrations, for I have particularly disproved almost every one of his Instances, and fully proved the custom of that Age could not admit any such kind of Consecrations; so that if (for want of Books and Records) there be five or six among Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his vast heap, which are not disproved by name, yet it is plain enough they also were confirmed as the rest were. But lest any scruple should remain, I will add two Arguments to prove there could be no Arbitrary Lay Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrations in this time.</p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:95318:128"/>
               <p>First, Because Lay-men could not give Parochial Tithes without Bishops consent, in regard Parochial right was so firmly setled all the time when these very Charters (which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> produces for Arbitrary Consecrations) were made, as I will prove out of him. <hi>Faricius</hi> Abbot of <hi>Abingdon, An.</hi> 1158. would not receive a gift of Tithes from <hi>Offin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> "lest he should diminish the ancient right of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Church; and till they had agreed to let the Parish Rector have Twenty four Sheaves out of every Acre, (which is a full Tenth part in ordinary Land) according as he used formerly to receive, he would not accept of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Tithing to the Abby, which here we see was paid beside Parochial Tithe<note n="(s)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 11. p. 302.</note>; and thus we must understand those second Tithes of Fruits and Corn, at <hi>Staves</hi> and <hi>Sandford,</hi> given to the Nuns of <hi>Kington</hi>
                  <note n="(t)" place="margin">Monast. Tom. 2. p. 288.</note>, <hi>viz.</hi> of Tithes paid over and above Parochial Tithes. And I appeal to any impartial Reader, if the setled right of Parish Tithes be not plainly declared in these Phrases, so often occurring among these very Instances of Mr. <hi>S. viz. De rebus quae De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimari solent</hi>
                  <note n="(u)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 11. p. 305, 306, 307, 324.</note>; <hi>Quae Decimari possunt &amp; debent</hi>

                  <note n="(y)" place="margin">Pag. 328.</note>; <hi>De quibus Decima rectè datur</hi>
                  <note n="(z)" place="margin">Pag. 328.</note>; <hi>Quae Decimari debent more Catholico</hi>

                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Pag. 333.</note>; <hi>Decimam quam Parochiani dant</hi>

                  <note n="(e)" place="margin">Pag. 302.</note>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All these plainly shew that Parochial Tithes were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual, and due to be paid by Parishoners to their Parish Church, and were a right belonging thereunto, setled by Law, Prescription, and ancient Custome; and if so, how then could any Arbitrary Consecrations be made out of them? We see by that Suit between the Parson of <hi>Frends<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> and the Chantor of <hi>Rochester,</hi> that Parochial right was sued for, before the year 1200, for the Parsons claim was grounded upon Parochial right<note n="(f)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> p. 317.</note>. And the Parsons consent was necessary to the Patrons alienation of Tithes; so that <hi>Alured,</hi> Priest of <hi>Stokes,</hi> about <hi>An.</hi> 1120, joyns with the Patron in the gift of that Church to the Canons of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:95318:129"/>
                  <hi>Southwark</hi>
                  <note n="(g)" place="margin">Monast. Tom. 2 p. 86.</note>, and <hi>Robert</hi> Priest of <hi>Walborton,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> Priest of <hi>Bernham,</hi> are Witnesses to the Grants of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Churches, <hi>An.</hi> 1180<note n="(h)" place="margin">Monastic. Tom. 1. p. 595.</note>; yea, <hi>Sarisburiensis</hi> informs us,, that <hi>Jus Parochiale cum Decimis,</hi> was judicially adjudged to <hi>Robert de Ʋngot</hi> before the year 1150<note n="(i)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sarisb.</hi> Ep. 21. pag. 503.</note>. Which proofs, with very many in the former Chapter do so fully assure us, of the settlement of Parochial right long before these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Grants, that this reason alone might suffice to shew they were not Arbitrary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the Laity could have made any such Grants of Tithes, the Monks durst not have received them, for fear of displeasing the Pope and the Bishops; for Mr. <hi>S.</hi> tells us, <q>The Decrees both of the Pope and General Councils were anciently against it—and the Provincial or National Synods here had like Canons forbidding it, <hi>viz. An.</hi> 1103, in a Council under <hi>Anselm,</hi> Monks are forbid to receive Churches, unless from the Bishop<note n="(k)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Spelm.</hi> Concil. T. 2. p. 34.</note>.</q> Another under the Popes Legate, <hi>An.</hi> 1125, ordains, <q>That no Abbot, Prior, or Monk, shall take a Tithe or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical benefit of a Lay mans gift, without the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and assent of their own Bishop, and if he do, the donation is declared void<note n="(l)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Spelm.</hi> ibid. pag. 36.</note>—and the King (saith Mr. <hi>S.</hi>) gave some allowance to these Canons<note n="(m)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> pag. 375.</note>;</q> but if he durst have told the truth, That King <hi>Henry</hi> the First confirmed these Canons by his Royal Authority, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it likely this very King should confirm so many arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Lay Consecrations, as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> pretends? or can any think the Monks durst (in despite of the Popes Decrees, and Bishops Canons, and the Kings Confirmation added thereto) frequently receive such Consecrations? I make no question they dared not to do it without the Bishops consent, and therefore there was no Lay arbitrary Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations in or about that Age, at least no common use of them.</p>
               <p n="2">§. II. This large and full proof will make it unnecessary to be very particular in answering the remote Conjectures which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> still brings to establish his false Opinion.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:95318:129"/> The ancient Writ which he urges out of the Register of <hi>Fitz-herbert</hi>
                  <note n="(n)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> pag. 353.</note>, he confesses to be a single Example, not seconded in any Law-Books elsewhere, yet against all reason he would have it refer to the common use of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Grants; but if any such use had been common, there would have been more Examples of such kind of prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Besides, if this were not till King <hi>Johns</hi> time (as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> guesseth) then this <hi>H.</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> was <hi>Hugh Wallis,</hi> who died not till 1234, and so it comes too late for the time he limited before. As for the Writ it self, it prohibits a Cause of Tithes to be tried in the Spiritual Court, between the Precentor of <hi>Lincoln</hi> (on whom the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> after the custom of his Predecessors had freely collated these Tithes) and the Prior of S. <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines,</hi> who claimed them as due to one of his Parish Churches; and the reason of the prohibition is, <hi>Because the collation of these Tithes might devolve to the King by reason of custody or escheat, since the King and many of his Nobles used to confer such Tithes in some of their Demesns.</hi> But if this were a special priviledge of the King, and of many (not, all) his Nobles, and in some of their Demesns only, then doubtless it was no Common right belonging to the Lord of every Mannor, as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> hath pretended, <hi>pag.</hi> 366. <hi>Exceptio firmat regulam,</hi> this special priviledge utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys his universal liberty. Besides Mr. <hi>S.</hi> fallaciously puts in the word <hi>[libere] pag.</hi> 355. where he is speaking of the King and his Nobles power to collate unto these Tithes, since the Writ apparently makes a difference between the Bishops Power, and the Kings or his Nobles, in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, saying, <hi>Episcopi loci praedicti liberè conferre consueve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt;</hi> but of the King and his Nobles it only saith, <hi>Conseri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> (not, <hi>liberè conferimus</hi>) the reason of which difference is easily this, That Bishops might collate to them without the leave or consent of any other; but both the King and his Nobles must have the Bishops consent. And if (as he thinks, <hi>pag.</hi> 55.) these Tithes were <hi>Decimae separatae,</hi> i. e. a portion taken out of some Parish Tithes, then we can prove, that the King and his Nobles had this priviledge
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:95318:130"/> (here claimed) by the Bishops consent at first, because Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops did separate such Portions by their Authority, as appears by Chartularies of <hi>Rochester,</hi> where it is said, <hi>The seperate portion of</hi> Crankburn <hi>Tithes in</hi> Hadlo <hi>Parish, was by the Bishops consent;</hi> and therefore at the Institution of a Parson of <hi>Hadlo</hi> the Bishop used to accept those separate Tithes. Now if the King or Nobles had any such privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from the Bishop at first, it secures the right of the Clergy in disposition of Tithes, and makes not for Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his purpose.

                  <note n="(q)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> p 36.</note>, shews, this was no Common right; and by the use of the time we have reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, this Privledge was granted him by the Pope and Bishop of the Diocess; for if it were granted from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Power, it could only allow him to do it without the Licence of any Secular Superior, but doth not exclude the Bishops assent. And it is very strange that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> should first say, <hi>It is specially found, of this one man,</hi> and then infer, that this liberty was common to all.</p>

                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:95318:130"/>§. III. As for the liberty challenged by Bishops and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons in King <hi>John</hi>'s time, to erect new Churches on their Land<note n="(r)" place="margin">Ib. p. 361.</note>, it will not prove a liberty of Arbitrary Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations in Lay-men, because the Bishop of the Diocess must dedicate this new Church, and ratifie the endowment thereof, or else the building was no Church, nor did the endowment legally belong to it; nor did this destroy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial right, but divide those Tithes between two Churches by Ecclesiastical consent, which were formerly enjoyed by one, both for convenience of the Parishioners, and encouraging of Devotion. And the Decretal of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,</hi> cited by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> to prove this right of the Barons, doth not say, <hi>They challenged this right without Episcopal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</hi> The Bishops of <hi>England,</hi> in their Letter to <hi>Innocent</hi> about this matter, say, <hi>By the Custom of</hi> England, <hi>Tam Archiepiscopi, quam Episcopi, quam etiam Laici, authoritate Diocesani Episcopi possint Ecclesiam conventionalem in suo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struere fundo.</hi> Gervas.

                     <hi>Innocent.</hi> 3. Decret. l. 1. pag. 288.</note>? And if Lay Barons did challenge a right of building Churches without consent, yet still the Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Ratification of the endowment made the Bishops consent absolutely necessary before the design could take effect. Again, the Cases about Tithes in <hi>Johannes Saris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buriensis</hi> do shew, that when two Churches contended about Tithes, he that proved <hi>Jus Parochiale,</hi> carried them<note n="(t)" place="margin">

And in the latter Example, Parochial right is proved by endowment at the Consecration, <hi>Episcopo</hi> Londi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nense <hi>praesente &amp; approbante</hi> (saith that Author:) so that <hi>An.</hi> 1150. Parochial right was a good plea in Law, and Endowments were made valid long before that, by Bishops at the Dedication. The Donation of <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Warren,</hi> which he here calls an Arbitrary Consecration<note n="(u)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> p. 362.</note>, he himself shews was made in the presence, and by the consent of divers Bishops<note n="(w)" place="margin">Ib. p. 340.</note>. Nor was there any need
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:95318:131"/> for Mr. <hi>S.</hi> to run so low as <hi>An.</hi> 1265. to find an instance of Tithes sued for upon this ground, because they were ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing within the Parish; for his former Instances out of <hi>Sarisburiensis,</hi> and divers others, confessed by him, and by me produced both in this and the former Chapters, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly shew that Suits upon that Title were far more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and that his <hi>English</hi> Monks either are sadly mistaken in fixing the beginning of Parochial right, or he grosly misinterprets them: see <hi>Chap.</hi> X. §. <hi>ult.</hi> And surely the Parson of <hi>Gillingham, An.</hi> 1278<note n="(x)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes</hi> p. 364.</note> durst not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the King himself, in Parliament, for detaining Tithes due to him (as growing within his Parish) <hi>De jure communi,</hi> if the Parochial right had not been setled long before; and this complaint shews the injury was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual, and the Parson very confident of his right, which doth no way hurt, but strengthen our Opinion.</p>
               <p n="4">§. IV. From the preceding evidence it is very plain, that whatever was done contrary to Parochial right, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of either Common or Canon Law in this Age, it was an Innovation and a Usurpation upon that ancient right, which was setled here long before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; but neither before the year 1200, nor afterward, was it lawful to dispose of Parochial Tithes without the Bishops consent. And for the Tithes of vast Forrests, and land not lying within the limits of any Parish, the Canon Law determines, they belong to the Bishop<note n="(y)" place="margin">Decretal. l. 3. tit. 30. pag. 1332.</note>; and <hi>Herle,</hi> an ancient Common Lawyer, <hi>An.</hi> 1333, is of the same Opinion<note n="(z)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> p. 368.</note>. But it seems the King, by virtue of his Prerogative, challenged a peculiar Power to dispose of these Tithes to what Church or Monastery he pleased, as King <hi>Henry</hi> the First did the Tithes of <hi>Inglewood</hi> Forrest to the Priory of <hi>Carlisle;</hi> yet let it be observed, That <hi>Henry</hi> the First (as is proved before) generally made his Grants of this kind with the Bishops consent, and so in all probability he had such consent to this gift; but however it is evident these Grants were so little used, that both the Parson of the adjacent Parish, and the Bishop, severally
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:95318:131"/> claim these Tithes, and sue the Prior for them, which shews that it was not yet determined in Law, whether these Grants of the King were good or no, nor yet to whom the right of these Tithes belonged. And if we grant to Mr. <hi>S.</hi> all he desires, yet the special Priviledge of the King, is no proof of any Common right in the Subjects; nor are Tithes of vast Forrests ever limited to any Parish, a fit parallel for Parochial Tithes, which after all his pretences do still appear so anciently and firmly setled, that the Laity could never arbitrarily dispose of them, and so we dismiss this tedious Chapter.</p>

               <p n="1">§. I. IN the next place Mr. <hi>S.</hi> makes a like unfortunate attempt to prove, that Lay Patrons did arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Appropriate whole Churches and Tithes to Monasteries. In the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, he saith, the Charters conveying them have usually nothing but <hi>Ecclesias,</hi> with some Land or Rent annexed<note n="(a)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> pag 370.</note>. The reason whereof may be, either because only the Patronage was then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, or rather, that Tithes and Churches were so constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly annexed in those times (before Bishops had consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to so many Grants of Tithes disposed from the Parish Church) that it was not necessary to name more than the Church, since no Tithes were then separated from it. But those Appropriations of <hi>Bertulph, Beorred,</hi> and <hi>Edred, Saxon</hi> Kings, which he cites out of <hi>Ingulphus</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ingulph.</hi> hist. p. 490, 492, 498.</note>, have the Subscription and Ratification of divers Bishops, yet extant in that Author, and so were made with Ecclesiastical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:95318:132"/> (as all such Donations in that Age were) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are no Arbitrary Lay Appropriations. Nor were there any such after the Conquest, for that Covenant, generally used in all these Conveyances, <hi>That the Incumbent of the Appropriate Church was to answer to the Monastery for Temporal Profits, and to the Bishop for Spiritual Jurisdiction,</hi> shews the Bishops joyned in the Conveyance, and so took care to secure their own Jurisdiction. And when we might have expected some Charters of Arbitrary Lay Appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> here sets down a Bishops Confirmation of Appropriate Churches within Seventeen years after the Conquest; and the Historian saith, it was by the Kings express order,<note n="(c)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hoveden,</hi> part. 1. p. 263. An. 1083.</note> and the Bishop there grants them by the words of <hi>Do &amp; Concedo.</hi> And if the Conqueror could do this by himself, why did he order the Bishop to do it? If it be objected, The Priory of <hi>Durham</hi> was possessed of these Churches before: I answer, Whenever they were given in any time of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> the custom ever was for the Bishops to sign the Grants. But let it be noted, that all the Churches given to Monasteries in that Age were not conveyed to them <hi>pleno jure,</hi> so as the Monks could take the Profits <hi>in usus proprios,</hi> and so they were not strictly Appropriations; the Abby at first only had the Patronage, and so presented a Clerk to the Bishop, who anciently had all the Profits, till first the Monks charged their Churches with Pensions by the Bishops connivance, and afterward got them wholly Appropriate to them by Bishops Charters, reserving only a Competent portion for the Vicar, which is usually set down in the Instrument of Appropriation: but to make it plain, that no Lay-man could make a Church to be Appropriate, let us consult the <hi>Monasticon,</hi> where there are very many forms of Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations yet extant. One by <hi>John</hi> Bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi> (consecrated <hi>An.</hi> 1177) confirmed by <hi>Hubert</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop<note n="(d)" place="margin">Monast. <hi>Angl.</hi> Tom. 1. p 638.</note>.

                     <hi>Thomas</hi> Parson of <hi>Koclestan,</hi> grants to the Hospital at <hi>Strodes,</hi> Ten shillings out of his Church yearly, assigned to the said Hospital by <hi>Gilbert</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester;</hi> and that this may be firm for ever, the said Parson sets his Seal to it.</q> Where we see both Bishops and Incumbents joyned in the Grant of Rents and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions out of Rectories, and so it was no arbitrary Act of the Patron. As for the Fine he cites<note n="(y)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> pag. 379.</note>, <hi>An.</hi> 1184, it seems the Church of <hi>Budcketun</hi> was made void at that time when the Patronage was in dispute, and therefore no Incumbent is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; but since the Prior of <hi>Lewes</hi> quits his whole claim for a Pension of 4 <hi>s. per An.</hi> we may reasonably believe it was only an old Pension renewed, or else the Prior would scarce have taken so small a compensation for his claim. However, it is sure the Patron and Prior both were sure of the Bishops consent, because they agree the Parson, <hi>Qui in eadem Ecclesiâ, per ipsum</hi> R. (the Patron) <hi>aut haeredes suos in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituetur, post institutionem suam coram Episcopo fidelitatem praestabit, &amp;c.</hi> that he will pay the aforesaid Four shillings. Nor need we be startled at the word <hi>Instituted,</hi> which is here used for the Patrons presenting, since the Incumbent was to go to the Bishop for admittance after such presenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Patron, and then he was to give security to the Bishop for this payment, because indeed the Grant had been void, if not made with his consent. The like may be said to his other instance of the Church of <hi>Kirkham</hi>
                  <note n="(z)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> p. 381.</note>, <hi>An.</hi> 1196. since there also the Incumbent was to give Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:95318:136"/> before the Bishop for true payment of the Pension. And indeed Mr. <hi>S.</hi> begins now to abate of his confidence, and (after a confession, that the Parson and Bishops assent was sometimes had) he only says now, <hi>It may be strongly conjectured, it was not thought altogether necessary;</hi> but our express Proofs shew it was necessary: to which we may add, <hi>The Confirmation of</hi> Benedict <hi>Bishop of</hi> Rochester (<hi>An.</hi> 1214) <hi>of a Pension of Forty shillings</hi> per An. <hi>out of the Church of</hi> Chealks, <hi>to the Monks of</hi> Norwich. And another of Five pound <hi>per An.</hi> to the same Monks from the same Church, <hi>Confirmed by</hi> Richard <hi>Bishop of</hi> Rochester, <hi>An.</hi> 1260.

But I reply, The very Bishops sometimes consented to such Succession, which occasioned that Canon in a <hi>London</hi> Council to forbid them to consent to it<note n="(q)" place="margin">An. 1237. ib. p. 226.</note>; yet above four year after the first Canon, the Pope by a Decretal to <hi>Anselm,</hi> allows him <hi>to admit the Sons of Priests into Churches, since the most and best of the</hi> English <hi>Clergy then were such</hi>
                  <note n="(r)" place="margin">An. 1107. ib. p. 29.</note>. But several of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations here out of the Canon Law, do shew that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops did institute Priests Sons into their Fathers Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices<note n="(s)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> pag. 386.</note>. His third Quotation speaks of a Priest, the Son of a former Incumbent, who had Canonically got the Living, and enjoyed it Thirty year, about <hi>An.</hi> 1150<note n="(t)" place="margin">Decret. l. 2. Tit. 20. cap. 7. pag. 766.</note>. The fourth is the same Case, saying more plainly, <hi>That he who possessed the Church of</hi> C.

The Eighth Quotation shews, that Incumbents of Livings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Abbies, promised Pensions to the Monks on condition they woul present their Sons after their decease<note n="(w)" place="margin">Ib. par. 28. cap. 8. p. 620.</note>; which implies, the Bishops would allow such Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:95318:137"/> till the Pope here forbid it. The last Quotation directs the Bishop, in what case he may admit Sons<note n="(x)" place="margin">Ib. par. 49. c. 14. pag. 640.</note>. These therefore do expresly shew, that Priests Sons did often succeed their Fathers by the Institution of Bishops, and therefore such succeeding in Benefices is no good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that the Bishops did not Institute in those days, or that Patrons without their consent could dispose of their Church Livings. His Second and Seventh Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>forbid Bishops to admit such Incumbents as Patrons nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, on condition of others to succeed them</hi>

As for the Verdict, <hi>An.</hi> 1195, of a Priest that gave a Living to his Son, according to the Custom of <hi>Cambridge</hi> then, let it be noted this Priest was both Patron and Incumbent, and so might well be said to give his Son the Living, if he gave him only a Presentation to it, to intitle him to the Bishops Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and those words, <hi>According to the Custom of</hi> Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge <hi>then,</hi> are put in, because of old, Priests Sons there might have succeeded their Fathers, though now when this Verdict was given, such Succession was not allowed. But suppose Mr. <hi>S.</hi> could find some few irregular Patrons and Priests, who in contempt of the Bishops ancient right, and the Laws did dispose of their Livings without his consent; yet we see this course was illegal, and the more usual custom was in all times to get the Bishops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
               <p n="5">§. V.

                     <hi>Hoveden</hi> pars poster. p. 336.</note>; and he might have found in the same Author, that the Dean of <hi>York</hi> did plead this very Law of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, for his refusing an Archdeacon of the West-riding, presented by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop after the Six Months was expired, <hi>An.</hi> 1195<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ib. p. 430. <hi>b.</hi>

                  </gap> is the oldest word used in this matter, even in <hi>Justinian</hi>'s Law, which he here cites; by which it is plain, that of old Patrons had no power but of bare Nomination, and if they have exercised any more since, it hath been by Usurpation. But the strangest thing of all is, that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> should cite <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Epistles to prove, that <hi>Nominatio</hi> signifies, <hi>to invest with an Office:</hi> When <hi>Brutus</hi> there, upon the Vacancy of the Consulship, desires <hi>Cicero</hi> (who, as being Augur, was to name the Candidates for vacant Offices) to name <hi>Bibulus, Neque enim</hi> (saith he) <hi>digniorem nominare potes quam Bibulum</hi>

All which strongly proves, that the Church Profits were always, and ought to be disposed by the Bishops consent.</p>

Nor was there any Law of this Kingdom in <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifths's time, to enable him to have made <hi>Infeodations</hi> to the Laity of Prior Aliens Tithes given him by Act of Parliament, wherefore that Prince justly disposed of them to other <hi>Ecclesiastics,</hi> which pattern if King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth had followed, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings had been far more justifiable. As for <hi>Infeodations,</hi> before the dissolution Mr. <hi>S.</hi> grants there is no certain Testimony of them in <hi>England,</hi> and the Proofs he brings are, at best, but remote Conjectures. Those Tithes which <hi>Odo,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bayeux</hi> and Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> confirms, viz. <hi>Decimas quas fideles ejus habebant.</hi> Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Chap. xi. pag. 1. seem to be no more but the Tithes of their Land, which they desired to give to the Monks of S. <hi>Augustines:</hi> and <hi>pag.</hi> 331. The Tithes given to <hi>Robert Saint-John</hi> by his elder Brother <hi>William,</hi> and by the said <hi>Robert</hi> given to <hi>Boxgrave,</hi> were no Parochial Tithes, but <hi>Decimas gabulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> the Tenth part of his Tolls, or his Rents in Mony. The Tithe of <hi>Nicholas de Stodeham</hi> was enjoyed by a Clergy Man (Curate of the place it is like) till he gave (and his Lord <hi>d'Oily</hi> confirmed) it to <hi>Osney,</hi> by the advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Bishop of the Diocess (as we proved before:) And if the story be true of <hi>Roger d'Oily</hi>'s giving his Tithes yearly sometimes to one Servant, and sometimes to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:95318:139"/> it is no example of an Infeodation, but an illegal, impious and wild Sacriledge; but Mr. <hi>S.</hi> gives little credit to this Author, <hi>pag.</hi> 401. As for <hi>Hern</hi> and <hi>Pigot</hi>'s case, he himself tells us, <hi>pag.</hi> 407. <hi>That continual consideration was given to the Church for the Tithes enjoyed by this Lay-man;</hi> so that this was a Composition or Tenancy, rather than an Infeodation. Wherefore there were anciently no Infeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations in <hi>England,</hi> nor would they be allowed (saith Mr. <hi>S.</hi>) at this day, unless they could derive them from the Grant of the Patron, Parson, and Ordinary; that is, unless they came from the Church, as we have fully proved they did in other Countries, <hi>Chap.</hi> VI. §. 4. and not only the Author of the Book of <hi>Osney,</hi> but <hi>Lindwood</hi> also is cited by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> to prove the truth of that Opinion<note n="(h)" place="margin">

The phrase in <hi>Domus-Dei</hi> Book, that such a Lay-man <hi>tenet Ecclesiam,</hi> and sold it to such an one, is only meant of the Patronage, which also was forbid to be sold a little after<note n="(i)" place="margin">Append. ad Concil. <hi>Later.</hi> cap. 15, 16, 17. <hi>Bin.</hi> Tom. 3. par. 2. pag. 603.</note>; and the phrase of <hi>Decimas aut Ecclesiam,</hi> is to denote the Profits and the Patronage<note n="(k)" place="margin">Ib. c. 18.</note>. The Kings having a share in the Oblations at the Church of <hi>Mosely,</hi> reaches not the matter of Tithes: so that neither his Examples nor his Arguments do shew there were any Infeodations in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">§. II. Since all <hi>Exemptions</hi> come originally from the Church, and are granted to such as were reckoned of old among the Clergy, though the Pope did ill to grant them, yet it no way makes for Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Opinion of Lay-mens arbitrary retaining or disposing Tithes, so that we need say nothing concerning them: Only, since these Exemptions from Tithes are grounded upon an unjust ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Papal power, and that also to such as were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of the Clergy, surely they are but a slender secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to a Lay Protestants Conscience, who rejects the Popes Authority, and yet by virtue of that Authority
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:95318:140"/> retains what is due to the Parish Minister by the Law of God, with which no Earthly power can dispense. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> tells us, The Parliament it self thought them so unjust, <hi>An.</hi> 1399, that by a Statute 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. c. 4. whoever procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any Bull for such Exemptions should be liable to a <hi>Praemunire</hi>
                  <note n="(l)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> p. 407.</note>. Nor do our present Laws allow any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription (saith Mr. <hi>S.) De non Decimando,</hi> unless where the Prescription began in a Church-man; and yet if it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue not still in the hands of a Church-man, the reason for which it began is ceased, and therefore (one would think) the priviledge <hi>De non Decimando</hi> should cease also. But our Laws do allow Compositions and Prescriptions of a <hi>Modus Decimandi,</hi> though made at first by the power and policy of the Laity, and confirmed by the negligence or corruption of the Clergy, and though the quantity paid be never so disproportionable to the original and just due: yet they who can claim such a priviledge, ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, whether the allowance of Secular Laws be a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rule for conscientious Christians to walk by in all cases; and whether Custom can make an ill thing become good, as also, whether any Incumbents ill bargains (who have but Estates for life) ought to be stood upon to the prejudice of their Successors; especially where these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions have made some Livings so small,<note place="margin">See Mr. his Review, pag. 476, 477.</note> that they have not left the Minister that competency, which all Men grant to be due by the Law of Nature as well as by the Law of Christ. If private gain did not pervert mens Judgments, they could not but discern they are obliged in Conscience to make some compensation at least for this injury, though Custom and humane Laws secure them from being compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable thereunto.</p>

THE matter of this Chapter doth so properly belong to Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Profession, that I shall not contend with him therein, nor is it much material in what Courts the right of Tithes be determined, provided such as are injured may find due remedy: Yet Mr. <hi>S.</hi> grants, <hi>That regularly the Jurisdiction of them, both here and in all other States of Christendom, belongs to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Court</hi>

And though this Court was anciently here the same with the <hi>Shire-mot,</hi> or <hi>County Court,</hi> yet we may gather from the <hi>Capitulars</hi> (whence many of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws are taken) that the Bishop only judged of these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the Sheriff was there only to distrain and force obedience to the Bishops Sentence<note n="(n)" place="margin">Leg. <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gob.</hi> Tit. 3. c. 7.

                  <hi>confirms the Tithes of</hi> Modingham <hi>to the Monks of</hi> Rochester, <hi>for which they were sued before him by the Parson of</hi> Eltham, <hi>but he by advice of Council had adjudged them to the Monks.</hi> Archbishop <hi>Theobald,</hi> about the year 1140, confirms the Tithes of <hi>Summerfield</hi> to the Priory of <hi>Leeds,</hi> which they had recovered before him in a Synod at <hi>Canterbury.

But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> undertakes to prove, that Original Suits for Tithes were held in the Kings, as well as in the Bishops Court, before King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seconds time<note n="(u)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> pag. 416.</note>: But his first instance of a Plea at <hi>Fulcardimont</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> is no evidence of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Practice; and in the Conqueror's time, for some years the Kings Court and the Bishops were all one. The Writ of <hi>Henry</hi> the First to <hi>Manasses Arsic,</hi> is no more but a strict Injunction to him to pay Tithes, and is no determination of right, but only (in pursuance of his own Law<note n="*" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 8. §. 17.</note>) an order to punish him, if he would not do justice in this matter: So also is the same Kings Writ for payment of such Tithes, as by custom and good proof were due to the Church of <hi>Beverley.</hi> The Precept about the Tithes of <hi>Pocklington</hi> and <hi>Driffield,</hi> is only to confirm the Bishop of <hi>Carlisle</hi>'s Grant<note n="(w)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> Ch. 11. p. 337.</note>, and by adding Secular Authority thereto, to take care it be duly executed. His next In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is after the time above prefixed (<hi>viz.</hi> 6. of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second) yet the Sheriff is only ordered to enquire of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:95318:141"/> matter of Fact, and thereupon to see right done: but none of the Instances expresly mention any Suit for the right of Tithes in the Kings Courts, only where the right was tried elsewhere, or well known to many Witnesses, the Kings Writs compel Offenders to pay their dues. <hi>Saris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buriensis</hi> indeed doth charge the King and his Lay Subjects with intermeddling in judging of Churches and Tithes<note n="(x)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sarisbur.</hi> Epist. 59.</note>; but he is wont to represent all things hard on the Kings side, and neither M. <hi>Paris,</hi> nor any other good Author, do reckon this among the Statutes of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> so that the truth of the Complaint may be doubted; and if these Suits for Tithes had been usual, surely more Testimony would have remained concerning them.</p>
               <p n="3">§. III. Concerning the Antiquity or Equity of Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting proceedings in the Bishops Courts, where Tithes are demanded of things not ordinarily paid, I shall not now dispute; only observe, that his first instance of such a Prohibition is but <hi>An.</hi> 1124, and that it was complained of as a great injury, in a National Synod, very soon after, viz. <hi>An.</hi> 1237<note n="(y)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> p. 422, 423.</note>. He tells us also, that (because the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law useth to judge of Advowsions, and the rights of Patronage, since the year 1285. the Judges have ordered all Trials in the Spiritual Court to be stopt, where the fourth part of any Churches Tithes are claimed, upon pretence, <hi>lest the Patronage be damnified:</hi> But he confesses, that neither <hi>Lindwood</hi>

                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Hist. <hi>Tithes,</hi> pag. 430.</note>, nor the National Council of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ib. p. 429.</note>, did think this a good reason for removing this Trial to the Common Law; because since the Patron can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not justly claim any interest in the profits of his Church, therefore his Patronage is not impaired by adjudging some of the Profits (hitherto wrongfully enjoyed) to belong to another Church; which reason is clear enough to those who are not made partial by prejudice. However, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> declares, that the Writ of <hi>Indicavit,</hi> only stops proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings till the Common Law hath discussed what concerns the Advowsion, but the final Sentence is to be given by
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:95318:142"/> the Spiritual Judge<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ib. p. 426.</note>: wherefore the right of Tithes is properly determined in the Spiritual Court, where the Suit is both begun and ended.</p>
               <p n="4, 5, 6">§. IV, V, VI. The Writs of <hi>Scire facias</hi> (to call men to answer for Tithes in the Chancery) being taken away by Statute Law, <hi>An.</hi> 1344<note n="(d)" place="margin">Ib. p. 434.</note>, in an Age when the Clergy ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lost than gained ground; we may believe it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the injustice of the thing, than the interest of the Clergy then, which caused it to be prohibited for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And while it was used, it seems only to have been an enquiry after matter of fact; and he grants, <hi>his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples go no further, than where the Tithes increased out of the Kings Demesns, or immediate Tenancies</hi>
                  <note n="(e)" place="margin">Ib. pag. 438.</note>; and he brings an instance there, that this Writ was not granted out, if the Tithes belonged to any private Subject; so that this belonging purely to the Kings Prerogative, ought not to be urged either for any general Practice with respect to Subjects, or for ordinary Jurisdiction. That Fine, <hi>An.</hi> 1210, only records an acknowledgment of <hi>Henry d'Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beny, That the Tithes of his Demesns of great</hi> Wicheford, <hi>were appertaining to the Church of</hi> Newton, <hi>yet the Chaplain of</hi> Wicheford (a Chappel of <hi>Newton) should receive them as he had anciently done</hi>
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">Ib. p. 440.</note>. Here is no Arbitrary dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, but an old Custom secured by a Fine upon mutual agreement. And that Example of a Writ upon a Patent, <hi>An.</hi> 1343, was not obeyed by the Abbot of <hi>Colchester,</hi> who saith expresly, <hi>He doth not think this Court ought to have cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of this matter;</hi> and the Case was so generally thought unjust, that this gave occasion to the Statute made the year after, to prohibit these Writs for ever after<note n="(g)" place="margin">Ib. p. 443.</note>. Finally, the Kings issuing out his Royal Command for paying Tithes, either where the right was plain (without any Suit) or where the Tithes arose out of his own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, seems to be no proof of the usual or ordinary Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of the Common Law over Tithes; but I am sensible of my own inability to determine things of this nature, wherefore I shall leave them to the more able
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:95318:142"/> Judgment of such whose Possession fits them for these En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries: It being sufficient for me, that I have Now proved Tithes were instituted by God, and revealed to, as well as practiced by the Patriarchs before the Law, commanded ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly under the Law, and not at all revoked, but esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the Gospel. That they were believed to be due by Gods Law among the Primitive Fathers, and most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Authors of all Ages, and paid freely in obedience thereunto by the first Christians; That afterward they were setled by Laws Civil and Ecclesiastical, and Penalties inflicted on those that detained them: and here in <hi>England,</hi> Tithes which were originally due to God, were freely setled on the Church by general Consent, and that settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment confirmed by innumerable Councils and Parliaments, and Tithes by virtue thereof enjoyed or disposed of by the Clergy for above 800 years together. All which duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, do prove Tithes are due both by the Law of God and Man, and may convince all that have the Jurisdiction over them, that they ought <hi>To give unto God the things that are Gods.</hi>
